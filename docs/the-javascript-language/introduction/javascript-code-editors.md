**Question:** **What is the main difference between an IDE and a Light-Weight editor?**

**Interview Answer:** The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project level. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

**Technical Answer:** The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project level, so it loads much more data when it starts, analyzes the project structure if needed, and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

**Addition Information:** In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and auto-completers, so there is no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.
