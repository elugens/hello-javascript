## Let's get started with the Basic JavaScript Questions

JavaScript is used today by companies such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and Facebook to build complex, desktop-like web applications. Since Node.js got introduced, it has become one of the most popular languages for building server-side software. Even the web cannot contain JavaScript's versatility in today's world.

Every front-end interview starts with a question about JavaScript, and these are the interviews that lead to the technical interview. To get into the technical interview, you must know JavaScript and be able to verbally/orally describe its concepts, syntax, and data types. This guide covers the basics of the JavaScript phone/zoom interview questions and answers. We'll also cover advanced concepts that you should know and show you how to answer them confidently.

### Phone Interview #1

A software engineer interview usually begins with a brief phone conversation with a recruiter. Your recruiter may ask about your interest in the role and discuss the essential requirements with you. The recruiter then helps you schedule the following interview with the company, usually another phone screen with the hiring manager and team front-end engineer.

### Phone Interview #2

You get asked more specific questions in this part of the interview process. The hiring manager may ask you some preliminary questions, but the front-end engineer conducts the interview. The interviewer asks you questions about front-end frameworks and technologies you are familiar with, and then you'll be asked a series of JavaScript questions. This part of the phone interview is where most software engineers fail to answer some of the most basic JavaScript questions.

### Our Goal

Our goal is to help you answer the most basic JavaScript questions by providing you with both the questions and the answers. We'll also provide you with a series of JavaScript interview questions that you can use to test your knowledge.
