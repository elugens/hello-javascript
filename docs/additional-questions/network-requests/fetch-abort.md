### What does it mean to "abort a fetch"?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Aborting a fetch means cancelling an ongoing fetch request. This can be useful when you no longer need the response or if the fetch takes too long.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the AbortController?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AbortController is an interface that allows you to cancel one or more web requests as and when desired using an AbortSignal.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How is an AbortSignal used?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AbortSignal is used by passing it to the fetch request. When the associated AbortControllerâ€™s abort() method is called, the fetch is cancelled.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What happens when you call the abort() method on an AbortController?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The abort() method signals to cancel the fetch operations associated with it. This causes the fetch promises to reject with an AbortError.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What error is thrown when a fetch is aborted?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When a fetch is aborted, it rejects the promise with a DOMException named AbortError.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How do you handle an abort error?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can handle an abort error in a catch block of the fetch promise, checking if the error's name is 'AbortError'.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you reuse an AbortController after calling abort()?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, once the abort() method is called on an AbortController, it can't be reset or reused.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can aborting fetches improve the performance of a web application?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, aborting unnecessary or slow fetches can free up resources and prevent unneeded processing, improving the overall performance.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Does aborting a fetch request also abort the process on the server side?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, aborting a fetch request only stops the client from listening to the response. It doesn't affect the process on the server side, which will usually complete as normal.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does the browser indicate an aborted fetch to the server?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The browser doesn't signal the server when a fetch is aborted. Once the request is sent, it's processed server-side regardless of client-side cancellation.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you abort a fetch after the response has started to arrive?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can call `controller.abort()` after the response starts arriving. This will reject the fetch promise with an `AbortError`, stopping the processing of the response.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What happens to the response object of an aborted fetch?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The response object of an aborted fetch is not fully received or processed. Attempting to read from it will reject the promise with an `AbortError`.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What if you don't provide an AbortSignal to a fetch request? What Happens?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> If you don't provide an AbortSignal to a fetch request, the fetch operation will continue as normal and cannot be programmatically cancelled using the AbortController mechanism.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you abort a fetch request from a worker?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can abort a fetch request from a web worker. The AbortController and AbortSignal are transferrable objects and can be used in web workers.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's an example of how to abort a fetch request from a worker:

In your main JavaScript file, you can post the `AbortSignal` to the worker:

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

worker.postMessage({ signal: controller.signal }, [controller.signal]);

// Abort the fetch operation after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
```

Then in `worker.js`, you handle the message and use the signal in a fetch request:

```javascript
self.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { signal } = event.data;

  fetch('https://example.com', { signal })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => self.postMessage(data))
    .catch(err => {
      if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
        console.log('Fetch operation aborted');
      } else {
        console.error('Fetch operation failed:', err);
      }
    });
};
```

In this example, the main script creates an `AbortController`, passes the `AbortSignal` to the worker, and then aborts the fetch after 2 seconds. The worker listens for messages, receives the `AbortSignal`, uses it in a fetch operation, and then sends the fetched data back to the main script. If the fetch is aborted, it logs an appropriate message.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the default state of an AbortSignal's aborted flag?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The aborted flag is initially set to false. It becomes true when abort() is called on the associated AbortController.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Is abort functionality exclusive to fetch or does it work with other APIs too?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Abort functionality is not exclusive to fetch. It can be used with any API that supports or is configured to work with the AbortSignal, including DOM APIs and various async tasks.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Is the AbortController part of JavaScript or the browser API?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AbortController is part of the Web API provided by browsers, not part of the core JavaScript language. It's specified in the DOM Living standard.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you use AbortController with async/await syntax?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, AbortController can be used with async/await syntax. When you abort, it causes the awaited fetch to throw an 'AbortError'.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's how you can use `AbortController` with async/await:

```javascript
// Create an instance of AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com', { signal });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Fetch operation aborted');
    } else {
      console.error('Fetch operation failed:', err);
    }
  }
}

fetchData();

// After 2 seconds abort the fetch operation
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
```

In this example, the fetch operation is aborted after 2 seconds, causing the `await fetch()` line to throw an `AbortError`, which is then caught in the catch block.

  </div>
  </div>

### Is it possible to cancel or abort an ongoing Fetch?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, it's possible to abort an ongoing Fetch using the AbortController and AbortSignal interfaces in the Fetch API. The `abort()` method on the AbortController cancels the Fetch.
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Yes, there is a special built-in object for such purposes: AbortController. We can use it to abort, fetch, and do other asynchronous tasks. The usage is very straightforward. The AbortController interface represents a controller object that allows you to abort one or more Web requests as and when desired. You can create a new AbortController object using the AbortController.AbortController() constructor. Communicating with a DOM request is done using an AbortSignal object (calling abort()).
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Could you perhaps clarify the purpose of the AbortController Object?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AbortController is a built-in JavaScript object that enables canceling ongoing activities, like Fetch requests, by invoking its `abort()` method, sending a signal to stop the operation.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Details:</strong> We must create a new AbortController constructor to implement the AbortController object. The controller is an object with a single abort method and a property signal that allows us to put event listeners on it. When abort() gets called, the controller invokes. The abort event transmits by controller.signal, and the attribute "controller. signal. aborted" becomes true. When abort() invokes on it, AbortController passes abort events.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let controller = new AbortController();
let signal = controller.signal;

// The party that performs a cancelable operation
// gets the "signal" object
// and sets the listener to trigger when controller.abort() is called
signal.addEventListener('abort', () => alert('abort!'));

// The other party, that cancels (at any point later):
controller.abort(); // abort!

// The event triggers and signal.aborted becomes true
alert(signal.aborted); // true
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Is it possible to cancel an event without using the AbortController?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, it's possible, but it typically involves setting and checking flags or using older APIs like XMLHttpRequest, which are less straightforward and flexible compared to using AbortController.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here is a simplified example of how one might cancel a fetch request without `AbortController`:

```javascript
let shouldAbort = false;

fetch('https://example.com')
    .then(response => {
        if (shouldAbort) throw new Error('Operation Aborted');
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
        if (shouldAbort) throw new Error('Operation Aborted');
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));

// Somewhere else in your code where you want to abort the fetch
shouldAbort = true;
```

In this case, we're using a flag (`shouldAbort`) to indicate whether the fetch should be cancelled. Note that this won't actually stop the fetch request from executing, it only prevents your code from handling the response. It's less effective than using `AbortController`.

  </div>
  </div>

### Why is it beneficial to use the AbortController object for cancelling fetch operations instead of implementing independent event listening in our code?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AbortController simplifies cancellation of fetch operations by creating a standardized, reusable solution, reducing code complexity, and making error handling and abort scenarios more predictable and easier to debug.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple code example showing how to use AbortController for cancelling fetch operations:

```javascript
// Create an instance of AbortController
let controller = new AbortController();
let signal = controller.signal;

// Start the fetch operation
fetch('https://example.com', { signal })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => {
        if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
            console.log('Fetch operation aborted');
        } else {
            console.error('Fetch operation failed:', err);
        }
    });

// Somewhere else in your code where you want to abort the fetch
controller.abort();
```

In this example, if you call `controller.abort()`, it will cancel the fetch operation, causing the promise to be rejected with an `AbortError`.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you cancel an ongoing fetch with the AbortController?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, to be able to cancel fetch, we must pass the signal property of an AbortController as a fetch option. The fetch method knows how to work with AbortController. It listens to abort events on a signal. Now, to abort, we call controller.abort(). At that point, fetch extracts the event from the signal and aborts the request.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here is a practical example of canceling an ongoing fetch operation with `AbortController`:

```javascript
// Create an instance of AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

// Start fetch operation
fetch('https://example.com', { signal })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => {
        if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
            console.log('Fetch operation aborted');
        } else {
            console.error('Other error', error);
        }
    });

// After 2 seconds abort the fetch operation
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
```

In this example, the fetch operation is aborted after 2 seconds, cancelling the ongoing fetch operation. If the fetch operation is still ongoing after 2 seconds, an `AbortError` will be thrown.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can the AbortController cancel or abort multiple fetches at once?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, AbortController is scalable by default. It allows us to cancel multiple fetches at once, which can be exceptionally helpful when dealing with an array.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let urls = [...]; // a list of urls to fetch in parallel

let controller = new AbortController();

// an array of fetch promises
let fetchJobs = urls.map(url => fetch(url, {
  signal: controller.signal
}));

let results = await Promise.all(fetchJobs);

// if controller.abort() is called from anywhere,
// it aborts all fetches
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>
