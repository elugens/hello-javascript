        text: 'The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript alternative to XMLHttpRequest, and it also performs the same task, network requests. The Fetch API also gets incorporated into the browser.

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. The fetch() method starts fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise that gets fulfilled once the response is available. Fetch has two arguments, including the URL and optional options object. The URL is the URL getting accessed on the server, and the options object holds an array of parameters, including method, headers, and other options.',

        text: 'First, the promise, returned by fetch, resolves with an object of the built-in Response class as soon as the server responds with headers. At this stage, we can check HTTP status to see whether it is successful and check headers, but we do not have the body yet. The promise rejects if the fetch could not make HTTP-request, e.g., network problems, or thereâ€™s no such site. We should note that abnormal HTTP statuses, such as 404 or 500, do not cause an error. We can check the response and status by using the response properties response.ok and response.status.',

Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent (browser) retains complete control over them.

We have to set the header and body inside the Fetch options. We are not limited to just post requests as a method option, and we also have access to HTTP requests and others.
