<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'result' property in FileReader contains the data that has been read from the file, representing the result of a successful file reading operation. Its data type depends on the method used to initiate the read.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How is 'readAsArrayBuffer()' method in FileReader used?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `readAsArrayBuffer()` method in FileReader is used to read the contents of a specified File or Blob object as an ArrayBuffer, which represents binary data in a fixed-length buffer.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is 'readAsBinaryString()' method in FileReader?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>

### What is the function of the 'onprogress' event in FileReader?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The "onprogress" event is a recurring occurrence that is triggered during the process of reading a file. Its purpose is to provide updates on the progress of the read operation, allowing the user to keep track of how much has been completed thus far.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the 'onloadstart' event in FileReader?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To set up tasks before a read operation starts, you use the `onloadstart` event. This event is triggered just before the read process is initiated, allowing for necessary preparation.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### How does the FileReader handle large files?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The FileReader API is not suitable for handling large files as it loads the entire file into memory, causing performance issues. Other alternatives like ReadableStream API or using server-side processing should be considered.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you explain the function of the File Object/Constructor?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The File object constructor in programming creates a file instance representing a file in the file system, providing methods to read, write, and manipulate the file.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> A File object inherits from Blob and gets extended with filesystem-related capabilities. A File object is a specific kind of a Blob and can be used in any context that a Blob can. In particular, FileReader, URL.createObjectURL(), createImageBitmap(), and XMLHttpRequest.send() which accepts both Blobs and Files. The File() constructor creates a new File object instance. The File constructor has three arguments: fileParts(bits), filename, and optional parameters. The fileParts can include an Array of ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, Blob, USVString objects, or a mix of any of such objects put inside the File. USVString objects get encoded as UTF-8. The filename is a USVString filename, and the optional options parameter is lastModified, which is the timestamp of the last modification.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<strong>Syntax: </strong> new File(fileParts, fileName, [options]);<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
var file = new File(['foo'], 'foo.txt', {
  type: 'text/plain',
});
```

  </div>
  </div>

### Can you explain how the FileReader Object functions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The FileReader object allows web applications to asynchronously read contents of files stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The FileReader object allows web applications to asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) saved on the user's machine by specifying the file or data to read with File or Blob objects. We can retrieve File objects via a FileList object returned by a user choosing files using the &#8249;input&#8250; element, from the DataTransfer object of a drag and drop operations, or through the mozGetAsFile() API on an HTMLCanvasElement. FileReader can only read the contents of files that the user has expressly selected, either through an HTML &#8249;input type="file"&#8250; element or by drag and drop. However, We cannot use it to read a file by pathname from the user's file system. We should note that OS level access is restricted in JavaScript.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<strong>Syntax: </strong> let reader = new FileReader(); // no arguments<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<input type="file" onchange="readFile(this)" />

<script>
  function readFile(input) {
    let file = input.files[0];

    let reader = new FileReader();

    reader.readAsText(file);

    reader.onload = function () {
      console.log(reader.result);
    };

    reader.onerror = function () {
      console.log(reader.error);
    };
  }
</script>
```

  </div>
  </div>
