### How does Clickjacking work?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Clickjacking works by overlaying invisible, interactive elements over benign webpage content. Users believe they're clicking on visible elements, while actually interacting with the unseen layer, unknowingly performing unwanted actions.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simplified code example to demonstrate a clickjacking attack:

```html
<!-- Malicious Page: attacker.html -->
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      #invisibleButton {
        position: absolute;
        opacity: 0;
        width: 200px;
        height: 100px;
        z-index: 9999;
        /* other styles to make it visually hidden */
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Click This Button!</h1>
    <iframe src="legitimate-website.com" width="800" height="400"></iframe>
    <button id="invisibleButton"></button>

    <script>
      // The button is positioned on top of the legitimate website
      // and is visually hidden, tricking users into clicking it
      document.getElementById("invisibleButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
        // Perform malicious action here, such as unauthorized transactions or data theft
        alert("You have been clickjacked!");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

In this example, the attacker creates a malicious webpage (`attacker.html`) with an invisible button (`#invisibleButton`) layered on top of a legitimate website shown within an iframe. When unsuspecting users visit the attacker's page, they are tricked into clicking the invisible button, triggering the malicious action (in this case, an alert message).

It's important to note that actual clickjacking attacks can be more sophisticated and involve complex techniques to conceal the malicious elements and deceive users effectively.

### What is frame-busting code?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Frame-busting code is JavaScript used to prevent a webpage from being displayed inside a frame or iframe, defending against clickjacking by disrupting the framing process.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is the X-Frame-Options header?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The X-Frame-Options is an HTTP response header used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page within a frame or iframe.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent attacks by specifying trusted content sources and disallowing the loading of resources from other origins.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

You can set a Content Security Policy by adding a `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in the server's responses.

Here's an example:

```js
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://images.example.com; script-src 'self'
```

In this example:

- `default-src 'self'`: Only load resources (like scripts, images, styles, etc.) from the same origin as the page itself.
- `img-src 'self' https://images.example.com`: Images can be loaded from the page's origin and also from `https://images.example.com`.
- `script-src 'self'`: Scripts can only be loaded from the page's origin.

This effectively limits where resources can be loaded from, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

### How can JavaScript detect Clickjacking attempts?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript can detect clickjacking attempts by comparing the window's top object to the self object. If they differ, the script could be running within a frame, suggesting clickjacking.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple JavaScript code snippet that checks if a page is being framed, which might indicate a clickjacking attempt:

```javascript
if (window.top !== window.self) {
   // The page is in a frame, this could be a clickjacking attempt
   alert("This page may be subject to a Clickjacking attack!");
}
```

In this code, `window.top` refers to the topmost window in the hierarchy of window objects, while `window.self` refers to the current window. If they are not the same, then the current page is inside a frame or an iframe.

  </div>

### How can Clickjacking attacks be prevented?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Defenses against clickjacking include implementing X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers that prevent site framing and employing frame-busting JavaScript code to disrupt the framing process.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br />

  <div></div>

Here are code examples for each:

1. X-Frame-Options HTTP Response Headers:
   If you're in control of the server, you can include this HTTP header in your responses:

```js
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

This option allows your site to be framed only by pages on the same domain. Frame Busting (Novice Approach: not recommended)

Frame-busting JavaScript Code: Frame-busting code can be included in the head of your HTML to ensure the page can't be framed. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
if (top !== self) top.location.replace(self.location.href);
```

This code checks if the current window (`self`) is the topmost window (`top`). If it's not (meaning the page is being framed), it changes the topmost URL to match the current page's URL, essentially breaking out of the frame.

:::note
Please note that these code examples provide a basic understanding of the approaches and may need to be adapted based on specific server configurations and coding practices.

### What is UI redressing?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> UI redressing is a malicious technique where an attacker manipulates the appearance of a website to deceive users into performing unintended actions, often used in clickjacking attacks.

### What is the role of the 'sandbox' attribute in preventing Clickjacking?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `sandbox` attribute in HTML5 restricts the actions an iframe can perform, potentially preventing clickjacking by disabling scripts, forms, or links to other pages, unless explicitly allowed.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here is an example of using the `sandbox` attribute with an iframe:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"></iframe>
```

In this example, the `sandbox` attribute is set to `allow-scripts allow-forms`. This means the framed content is allowed to run scripts and submit forms. Without these explicit allowances, the `sandbox` attribute would block these operations. Other potential values include `allow-same-origin`, `allow-popups`, and `allow-top-navigation`.

However, if the attribute is set without any value:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox></iframe>
```

It applies the strictest restrictions: the framed content cannot run scripts, submit forms, or navigate the top page, effectively isolating it and providing a strong defense against clickjacking.

### How does the 'X-Content-Type-Options' header help prevent Clickjacking?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The X-Content-Type-Options header doesn't directly prevent Clickjacking. Its main function is to stop MIME-type sniffing, which can help prevent certain types of attacks, like drive-by downloads.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the impact of using the 'allow-same-origin' directive in the 'X-Frame-Options' header?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `X-Frame-Options` header doesn't support the 'allow-same-origin' directive. It only supports `DENY` and `SAMEORIGIN`, which prevent all framing and allow framing by the same origin respectively.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does the 'frame-ancestors' directive in Content Security Policy (CSP) mitigate Clickjacking?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'frame-ancestors' directive in the CSP specifies domains allowed to frame a site. This restricts potential click-jackers from framing the page, thus mitigating clickjacking threats.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is a reverse Clickjacking attack?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Reverse clickjacking is when an attacker uses a legitimate website's functionality against itself by tricking users into interacting with it in unintended ways, usually through a disguised overlay.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How can the JavaScript 'window.blur()' method be used to counter Clickjacking?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `window.blur()` method can't effectively counter clickjacking. Its function is to remove focus from the current window, but it doesn't prevent a site from being framed or users from interacting with hidden elements.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What are the challenges in detecting and preventing Clickjacking attacks on mobile devices?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Mobile clickjacking is challenging due to user-interface redressing, smaller screens causing overlapping elements, lack of visibility of full URLs, and less robust security options available in mobile browsers.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can Clickjacking be exploited without JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, clickjacking can be exploited without JavaScript. It can be achieved purely through HTML and CSS, by using frames and CSS properties to overlay invisible interactive elements over visible content.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How can the 'X-Frame-Options' header be set using JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `X-Frame-Options` header cannot be set using JavaScript. It's an HTTP response header that must be set on the server-side by the server or application handling the response.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Are modern browsers effective at preventing Clickjacking attacks?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Modern browsers have implemented various security measures like the X-Frame-Options header, Content Security Policy (CSP), and frame-busting scripts, making them more effective at preventing Clickjacking attacks.
