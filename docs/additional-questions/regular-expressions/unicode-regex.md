### How many bytes are Unicode characters?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript uses Unicode encoding for strings. Most characters are encoded with 2 bytes, but that allows to represent at most 65536 characters. That range is not big enough to encode all possible characters, that is why some rare characters are encoded with 4 bytes, for instance like ùí≥ (mathematical X) or üòÑ (a smile), some hieroglyphs and so on. So, the simple answer is 2 bytes for regular ‚Äúold‚Äù characters and 4 bytes for special ‚Äúsurrogate pairs or new‚Äù characters. A long time ago, when JavaScript language was created, Unicode encoding was simpler, there were no 4-byte characters. So, some language features still handle them incorrectly. By default, regular expressions also treat 4-byte ‚Äúlong characters‚Äù as a pair of 2-byte ones. And, as it happens with strings, that may lead to odd results.

  <div></div>

```js
// Both characters return a length of 2,
// it should be 1, but these are special characters
alert('üòÑ'.length); // 2
alert('ùí≥'.length); // 2

### How are Unicode properties expressed in regular expressions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In simple terms, Unicode properties are denoted or expressed as \p&#123;‚Ä¶&#125;. To use \p&#123;‚Ä¶&#125;, a regular expression must have flag u. For instance, \p&#123;Letter&#125; denotes a letter in any language. We can also use \p&#123;L&#125;, as L is an alias of Letter. There are shorter aliases for almost every property.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let str = 'A ·Éë „Ñ±';

alert(str.match(/\p{L}/gu)); // A,·Éë,„Ñ±
alert(str.match(/\p{L}/g));
// null (no matches, \p does not work without the flag "u")
```

### What approach should we use to handle script-based languages, like Chinese, in regular expressions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When we are handling script-based languages like Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, or Han (Chinese). We should use the Unicode property for the Script writing system. This can be achieved by using the Script=&#8249;value&#8250; syntax.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let regexp = /\p{sc=Han}/gu; // returns Chinese hieroglyphs

let str = `Hello –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç ‰Ω†Â•Ω 123_456`;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // ‰Ω†,Â•Ω
```

### What Unicode property should we use in regular expressions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Characters that denote a currency, such as $, ‚Ç¨, ¬•, have Unicode property \p&#123;Currency_Symbol&#125;, the short alias: \p&#123;Sc&#125;, that we should use.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let regexp = /\p{Sc}\d/gu;

let str = `Prices: $2, ‚Ç¨1, ¬•9`;

alert(str.match(regexp)); // $2,‚Ç¨1,¬•9
```
