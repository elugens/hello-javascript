### What is a quantifier in JavaScript Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> We can use a quantifier to find the exact count in a sequence of digits. For example, if we are looking for a sequence of numbers like 123-456. We can used \d&#123;3&#125; which will return 123,456.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In JavaScript Regex, a quantifier is a symbol or character that specifies how many times a certain element or group of elements in a pattern should be matched. Examples of quantifiers include the asterisk (*), which matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element, and the plus sign (+), which matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element. Other quantifiers include the question mark (?), which matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element, and the curly braces (&#123; &#125;), which can be used to specify a specific range of occurrences.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// Sequence of digits
console.log("I'm 12345 years old".match(/\d{5}/)); //  "12345"

// Range of digits
console.log("I'm not 12, but 1234 years old".match(/\d{3,5}/)); // "1234"

// Omitting the upper range with \d{3,}
console.log("I'm not 12, but 345678 years old".match(/\d{3,}/)); // "345678"

// Implementation on a range and omitting the upper range
let str = '+7(903)-123-45-67';

let numbers = str.match(/\d{1,}/g);

console.log(numbers); // 7,903,123,45,67
```

### What does the '*' quantifier mean in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In regular expressions, the symbol (*) is known as the quantifier for "zero or more of the preceding character." To illustrate, the regular expression pattern /a*b/ can match any string that starts with "a" and ends with "b," regardless of the number of "a" characters present between them.

### What does the '?' quantifier mean in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Regex uses the question mark (?) quantifier to represent "zero or one of the preceding character." For instance, the pattern /a?b/ matches any string that starts with "a" and ends with "b," with either no or one "a" in between.

### What does the &#123;n,&#125; quantifier mean in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The &#123;n,&#125; quantifier means 'n' or more occurrences of the preceding element. You can specify a specific number of occurrences in regex by using the curly braces (&#123; and &#125;) quantifier. For example, the regex pattern /a&#123;3&#125;b/ will match any string that begins with the letter "a" and ends with the letter "b," with exactly three letters "a" in between.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### What does the &#123;n,m&#125; quantifier mean in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The &#123;n,m&#125; quantifier means between 'n' and 'm' occurrences (inclusive) of the preceding element.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can quantifiers be used with groups in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, quantifiers can be applied to groups, specifying the number of group occurrences to match.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### What is the difference between greedy and lazy quantifiers in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Greedy quantifiers match as many occurrences as possible, while lazy quantifiers match as few as possible.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### What is the difference between '+' and '* ' quantifiers in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In regular expressions (regex), the '+' quantifier matches the preceding element one or more times, while the '*' quantifier matches it zero or more times.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can we use quantifiers with character classes in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, quantifiers can be used with character classes in regex. They allow you to specify how many times a character or set of characters within the character class should be matched.
  </div><br />

### How do you represent 'n' or more occurrences in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To represent 'n' or more occurrences in regex, you can use the '&#123;n,&#125;' quantifier. It matches the preceding element 'n' or more times.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does a non-greedy quantifier work in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A non-greedy quantifier in regex, denoted by adding a '?' after the quantifier, matches the shortest possible match instead of the default greedy behavior. It stops as soon as the next element in the pattern can be matched.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### How do you match exactly 'n' times of a certain character?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To match exactly n times of a certain character, you can use the &#123;n&#125; quantifier in regex. For example, the regex pattern /a&#123;3&#125;/ will match any string that contains exactly three a characters.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you match a certain range of repetitions with Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To match exactly n times of a certain character, you can use the &#123;n&#125; quantifier in regex. For example, the regex pattern /a&#123;3&#125;/ will match any string that contains exactly three a characters.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a JavaScript code example demonstrating the use of regex with the '{min,max}' quantifier to match a certain range of repetitions:

```javascript
const regex = /a{2,4}/;
const testString = "aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa";

const matches = testString.match(regex);
console.log(matches); // Output: ["aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]
```

In this example, the regex pattern `/a{2,4}/` will match the letter 'a' repeated between 2 to 4 times. The `match()` method is used to find all matches in the `testString` and return them as an array. The resulting matches are then printed to the console.

### Is it possible to use quantifiers with special characters in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, quantifiers can be used with special characters, indicating how many times the special character should occur.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How can you make a character optional in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> By using the '?' quantifier, you can make a character optional, meaning it could appear zero or one time.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How do you make a quantifier lazy in Regex?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> By adding a '?' after the quantifier, you can make it lazy. This makes it match as few occurrences as possible.

### Are there any shorthand alias quantifiers in regular expressions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, there are shorthand alias quantifiers: '*' for zero or more, '+' for one or more, and '?' for zero or one.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> There are shorthands for most used quantifiers, like \d+ which looks for numbers and is a shorthand way for \d&#123;1,&#125;,. Quantifiers are often employed, and they are the fundamental "building block" of sophisticated regular expressions. Using shorthand aliases can help reduce the code necessary to implement an expression.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let str = '+7(903)-123-45-67';
console.log(str.match(/\d+/g)); // 7,903,123,45,67

let str = 'Should I write color or colour?';
console.log(str.match(/colou?r/g)); // color, colour

console.log('100 10 1'.match(/\d0*/g)); // 100, 10, 1

console.log('100 10 1'.match(/\d0+/g)); // 100, 10
// 1 not matched, as 0+ requires at least one zero
```
