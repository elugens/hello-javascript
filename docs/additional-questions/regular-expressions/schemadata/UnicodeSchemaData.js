        text: 'JavaScript uses Unicode encoding for strings. Most characters encode with 2 bytes, but that allows them to represent at most 65536 characters. That range is not big enough to encode all possible characters, so some rare characters are encoded with 4 bytes, for instance, like ùí≥ (mathematical X) or üòÑ (a smile), some hieroglyphs. So, the simple answer is 2 bytes for regular ‚Äúold‚Äù characters and 4 bytes for special ‚Äúsurrogate pairs or new‚Äù characters. When the JavaScript language got created a long time ago, Unicode encoding was more straightforward; there were no 4-byte characters. So, some language features still mishandle them. By default, regular expressions also treat 4-byte ‚Äúlong characters‚Äù as a pair of 2-byte ones. And, as it happens with strings, that may lead to odd results.',

For instance, \\p&#123;Letter&#125; denotes a letter in any language. We can also use \\p&#123;L&#125;, as L is an alias of Letter. There are shorter aliases for almost every property.',
