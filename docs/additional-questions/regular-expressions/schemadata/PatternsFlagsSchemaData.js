The extended syntax uses the RegExp object with optional flags, and the short syntax uses forward slashes with optional flags. Slashes /.../ tell JavaScript that we are creating a regular expression, and they play the same role as quotes for strings. In both cases, regexp becomes an instance of the built-in RegExp class.',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The match method has three working regex modes. First, if a regular expression has flag g, it returns an array of all matches. Second, if there is no such flag, it returns only the first match in the form of an array, with the whole match at index 0 and some additional details in properties. The array may have other indexes besides 0 if a part of the regular expression gets enclosed in parentheses. And finally, if there are no matches, null is returned (it does not matter if thereâ€™s flag g or not). This behavior is an essential nuance. If there are no matches, we do not receive an empty array but instead receive null. Forgetting about that may lead to errors, e.g.',
