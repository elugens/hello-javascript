### What is a word boundary \b in regular expressions (regexp)?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A word boundary '\b' in regex represents the position where a word character is not followed or preceded by another word character.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> A word boundary \b is a test, just like ^ and $. When the regexp engine (program module that implements searching for RegExp) comes across \b, it checks that the position in the string is a word boundary. Three different positions qualify as word boundaries in regular expressions. For instance, if the first string character is a word character \w. Also, between two characters in the string, where one is a word character \w, and the other is not, and at the string end if the last string character is a word character \w. We can use \b not only with words but also with digits.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
console.log('Hello, Java!'.match(/\bJava\b/)); // Java
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!'.match(/\bJava\b/)); // null

// More Examples

console.log('Hello, Java!'.match(/\bHello\b/)); // Hello
console.log('Hello, Java!'.match(/\bJava\b/)); // Java
console.log('Hello, Java!'.match(/\bHell\b/)); // null (no match)
console.log('Hello, Java!'.match(/\bJava!\b/)); // null (no match)

// Digit Boundaries
console.log('1 23 456 78'.match(/\b\d\d\b/g)); // returns 23,78
console.log('12,34,56'.match(/\b\d\d\b/g)); // returns 12,34,56
```

### Does a word boundary work on Non-Latin alphabets?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Word boundaries may not function as expected with Non-Latin alphabets as they're designed to work with alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Details:</strong> The word boundary test \b checks that there should be \w on the one side from the position and "not \w" â€“ on the other side. But \w means a Latin letter a-z (or a digit or an underscore), so the test does not work for other characters, e.g., Cyrillic letters or Hieroglyphs.
