### What is Tweening in animation?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Tweening, or in-betweening, is the process of generating intermediate frames between two states to give the impression that the first image has smoothly evolved into the second one.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the 'Animation Loop' in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'Animation Loop' in JavaScript is a continuous cycle that updates the animation frames at a set interval, typically using requestAnimationFrame, to create fluid and seamless visual movement.
  </div><br />
  </div>

---

### What's the role of 'timing function' in animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A 'timing function' in JavaScript animations defines the speed at which the animation progresses at different points in its duration, allowing control over acceleration, deceleration, and easing of the animation.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What are sprite animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Sprite animations are a series of images (2D image) along the x/y-axis, collected into a single image file (sprite sheet), that are displayed in sequence using CSS or JavaScript to create the illusion of movement.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is 'frame rate' in the context of animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Frame rate in animations refers to the number of individual images (frames) displayed per unit of time, typically per second. Higher frame rates generally result in smoother, more fluid animations.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How do JavaScript callbacks relate to animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript animations, callbacks are functions executed at certain points, such as the start or end of an animation, or on each frame. They allow for dynamic control and sequencing of animations.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does 'throttling' improve animation performance?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Throttling limits the rate at which a function is executed. It can prevent unnecessary computations, improving performance of animations and user interactions.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is 'debouncing' and how does it relate to animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Debouncing in JavaScript is a technique that limits the rate at which a function can fire. In animations, it's often used to improve performance by reducing unnecessary computations during events like scrolling or resizing.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What are 'CSS Keyframes' and how can they be manipulated with JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> CSS Keyframes define the behavior of an animation sequence. JavaScript can manipulate these to dynamically control the animation.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Why is it recommended to animate properties like opacity and transform in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Animating properties like opacity and transform in JavaScript is recommended because these changes can be handled by the GPU. This results in smoother, more performant animations compared to animating layout properties.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Why is requestAnimationFrame better than setInterval or setTimeout?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `requestAnimationFrame` is superior as it synchronizes with the browser's refresh rate, leading to smoother animations. Unlike `setInterval` or `setTimeout`, it also pauses when the tab is inactive, saving resources.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you explain the function of the requestAnimationFrame method?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `window.requestAnimationFrame()` tells the browser to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The window.requestAnimationFrame() method informs the browser that you want to run animations and asks the browser to invoke a given function to update an animation before the next repaint. The method accepts a callback as an input, executed before the repaint. When you're ready to refresh your animation onscreen, call this function. We may cancel the animation by contacting the request-id in the cancellation using the cancelAnimationFrame.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<strong>Syntax: </strong> let requestId = requestAnimationFrame(callback);<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
const element = document.getElementById('some-element-you-want-to-animate');
let start;

function step(timestamp) {
  if (start === undefined) start = timestamp;
  const elapsed = timestamp - start;

  // `Math.min()` is used here to make sure that the element stops at exactly 200px.
  element.style.transform =
    'translateX(' + Math.min(0.1 * elapsed, 200) + 'px)';

  if (elapsed < 2000) {
    // Stop the animation after 2 seconds
    window.requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
}

window.requestAnimationFrame(step);
```

  </div>
  </div>

### When should we use JavaScript vs. CSS for animations?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You should use CSS for simpler animations, it's lightweight and performant. You should use JavaScript when you need complex, programmable animations, interaction-based animations, or if you need more control over animation timing.
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> For animations that CSS cannot handle well, or those that need tight control, JavaScript is our best option. We should implement JavaScript animations via requestAnimationFrame. The requestAnimationFrame built-in method allows us to set up a callback function to run when the browser is preparing a repaint. Usually, that is very soon, but the exact time depends on the browser.
