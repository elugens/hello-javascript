  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It allows us to run, debug, inspect, analyze, and manipulate JavaScript in the browser.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The developer console resembles a shell interface and has tools for viewing the DOM, debugging, and analyzing network traffic.

The console essentially allows you to generate, administer, and monitor JavaScript.
