  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project level. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project level, so it loads much more data when it starts, analyzes the project structure if needed, and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Additional Information:</strong> In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and auto-completers, so there is no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.
