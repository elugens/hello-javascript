<details>

  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The primary difference between a lightweight editor and an IDE is that an IDE works on a project level. Using a lightweight editor is faster if all we need is one file.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In contrast to a lightweight editor, an IDE works on the project level, so it loads more data when it starts, analyzes the project structure, if necessary, etc. We can use a lightweight editor if we only need to edit one file.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Additional Information:</strong> There is no strict boundary between a lightweight editor and an integrated development environment since lightweight editors often have a wide range of plugins, such as directory-level syntax analyzers and auto-completers.
