### What is the primary difference between an IDE and a lightweight editor?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project level. A lightweight editor is considerably faster than an IDE if we require one file.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In contrast to a lightweight editor, an IDE works on the project level, so it loads more data when it starts and analyzes the project structure, if necessary. We can use a lightweight editor if we only need to edit one file.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Additional Information:</strong> TThere is no strict boundary between a lightweight editor and an integrated development environment since lightweight editors often have a good selection of plugins, such as directory-level syntax analyzers and auto-completers.
