### What are the potential security risks associated with using the eval function?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The main risk is the potential for code injection, where malicious code can be executed. It's important to validate and sanitize any input used with `eval`.<br />

### Is it recommended to use the `eval` function in production code?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In general, it is discouraged to use `eval` in production code due to security risks and potential performance implications. There are usually alternative approaches to achieve the desired functionality.

### What is the purpose of the eval() function in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The eval() function is used to evaluate a string as a JavaScript expression or code snippet, allowing dynamic execution of code. However, it's generally discouraged due to security risks.
</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> According to the MDN, the honest answer is that you should never use eval in your applications. However, the purpose of eval is to evaluate JavaScript code represented as a string value. One string parameter evaluates in the built-in eval function, and returns the completed value of the evaluated code. If the completion value is empty, undefined is returned.

```js
let code = 'alert("Hello")';
eval(code); // alerts Hello
```

### Should you use the eval built-in JavaScript function property? Why or why not?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> We should never use eval in modern applications. Many problems include security, optimization, speed, and minification compatibility issues. The MDN does not recommend its use in modern programming.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In modern programming, developers use eval very sparingly. Developers often say that “eval is evil”. The reason is simple: a long, long time ago, JavaScript was a weaker language; many things only worked with eval. But that time passed a decade ago. There is no reason to use eval because the JavaScript engine does not optimize it. If someone is using it, there is a good chance they can replace it with a modern language construct or a JavaScript Module. Evil, I mean eval has several issues, including speed and code minification compatibility issues. The fundamental problem is that it poses a security risk to the user, and the MDN does not recommend its use in modern programming.<br /><br /> Using external local variables inside eval is also considered a bad programming practice, as it makes maintaining the code more complex. If your code needs some data from the outer scope, use “new” Function and pass it as arguments.
  </div><br /><br />

:::warning
Executing JavaScript from a string is an enormous security risk. It is far too easy for a bad actor to run arbitrary code when using eval().

### Is there a better option or built-in JavaScript object than eval that you can use?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, safer alternatives to eval() include the Function constructor for creating functions dynamically or JSON.parse() for parsing JSON strings without executing arbitrary code.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong> Converting from eval to a Function() object.<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// Bad code with eval():
function looseJsonParse(obj) {
  return eval('(' + obj + ')');
}

console.log(looseJsonParse('{a:(4-1), b:function(){}, c:new Date()}'));

// Better code without eval():
function looseJsonParse(obj) {
  return Function('"use strict";return (' + obj + ')')();
}

console.log(looseJsonParse('{a:(4-1), b:function(){}, c:new Date()}'));
```
