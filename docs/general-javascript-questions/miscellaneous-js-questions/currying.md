### What is currying in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying is a technique in which a function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each accepting a single argument and ultimately returning the final result. It is used not only in JavaScript but in other languages as well. Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c). Currying does not call a function; it just transforms it. Currying allows us to extract partials quickly.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function curry(f) {
  // curry(f) does the currying transform
  return function (a) {
    return function (b) {
      return f(a, b);
    };
  };
}

// usage
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let curriedSum = curry(sum);

alert(curriedSum(1)(2)); // 3
```

### What is the main rule of currying functions in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The main rule of currying functions in JavaScript is to transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take one argument. A function with rest parameters, such as f(...args), cannot be curried in this manner.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong> This is an example of Advanced Currying.<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function curry(func) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= func.length) {
      return func.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      return function (...args2) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));
      };
    }
  };
}

function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

let curriedSum = curry(sum);

alert(curriedSum(1, 2, 3)); // 6, still callable normally
alert(curriedSum(1)(2, 3)); // 6, currying of 1st arg
alert(curriedSum(1)(2)(3)); // 6, full currying
```

### Why is currying useful?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying is useful for creating specialized functions, improving code reusability, and enabling partial application of arguments for more modular and maintainable code.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is a partial application?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Partial application is a process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, generating a new function that accepts the remaining arguments.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you curry built-in JavaScript functions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, built-in JavaScript functions can be curried, but some may require adapting to accept single arguments using custom currying functions.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does currying relate to functional programming?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying is a key concept in functional programming, as it promotes code reusability, modularity, and the creation of specialized functions by applying arguments incrementally.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the arity of a function?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Arity refers to the number of arguments a function accepts. In currying, functions are broken down into a series of functions with an arity of one.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can currying impact performance?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying can have some performance overhead due to the creation of multiple functions and closures, but the benefits of improved code modularity and reusability often outweigh these costs.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does currying differ from function composition?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying transforms a function into a series of single-argument functions, while function composition combines two or more functions to create a new function, using the output of one as the input for another.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does currying work with higher-order functions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Currying is often used with higher-order functions, as it enables the creation of specialized functions by partially applying arguments, resulting in more modular and reusable code.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is point-free style in functional programming?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Point-free style is a coding approach that emphasizes creating functions without explicitly mentioning their arguments, often using currying and function composition for more concise and readable code.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you use currying with async functions in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, currying can be used with async functions. However, handling promises and async/await may require adapting the currying function to properly handle asynchronous behavior.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does currying compare to using default parameters in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> While both currying and default parameters enable partial application of arguments, currying transforms a function into a series of single-argument functions, whereas default parameters allow for optional arguments in a single function.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you curry a function with a variable number of arguments?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, but it requires additional logic to handle variable arguments, such as using a currying function that keeps track of the expected number of arguments before invoking the original function.<br />
  </div><br />
  </div>
