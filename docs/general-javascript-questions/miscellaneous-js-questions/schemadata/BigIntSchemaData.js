        text: 'BigInt is a unique numeric type that allows integers of any length. A BigInt gets formed by attaching n to the end of an integer literal or by using the BigInt function, which generates BigInts from strings, numbers. BigInt gets used chiefly as a regular integer. All operations on BigInts return BigInts. BigInts and regular numbers cannot be blended. If necessary, we should explicitly convert them using BigInt() or Number(). The conversion procedures are always quiet and never produce errors, but if the BigInt is too huge, it wonâ€™t fit the number type, and excess bits get chopped off; thus, we should exercise caution while doing such conversions.',
