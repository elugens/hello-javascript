### How do you reduce the number of unnecessary comments in your code?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The key to reducing unnecessary comments in your code is to write self-descriptive code. The best way to achieve this is to replace a chunk of code with a function.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong> Confusing Code<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function showPrimes(n) {
  nextPrime: for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    // check if i is a prime number   <-- this is an unnecessary comment
    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
    }

    alert(i);
  }
}
```

  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong> Good Code<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// The better variant, with a factored-out function isPrime:
function showPrimes(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    if (!isPrime(i)) continue;

    alert(i);
  }
}

function isPrime(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) return false;
  }

  return true;

### What are Good comments in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Good comments in JavaScript provide a high-level overview of the code architecture, including how components interact. They focus less on explaining code functionality and more on documenting function parameters and usage. They provide a bird's eye view of the code.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
/**
 * Returns x raised to the n-th power.
 *
 * @param {number} x The number to raise.
 * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.
 * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.
 */
function pow(x, n) {
  ...
}
```
