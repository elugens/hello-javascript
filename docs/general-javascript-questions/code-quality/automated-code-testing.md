### Can you name some automated JavaScript testing frameworks?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> There are several automated testing frameworks that we can use in JavaScript development, including Unit.js, QUnit, Jasmine, Karma, Mocha, Jest, and AVA.<br/><br/>
      <strong>The following is a collection of JavaScript Unit Testing Frameworks and Tools:</strong><br/><br/>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit.js</strong> is a Javascript assertion library that runs on Node.js and the browser. It is compatible with any test runner and unit testing framework, including Mocha, Jasmine, Karma, protractor (E2E test framework for Angular applications), QUnit, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>QUnit</strong> is a user-friendly and robust JavaScript testing framework. It was created for the jQuery project and has since expanded into a dependency of many current JavaScript libraries and apps, including the Ember.js ecosystem's default testing framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Jasmine</strong> is a behavior-driven programming framework that allows you to unit test JavaScript. It can test both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code. It does not require DOM and has a simple syntax that we can use to write any test.</li>
        <li><strong>Karma's</strong> primary purpose is to provide developers with a productive testing environment. The environment is one in which they do not have to set up a plethora of setups but rather one in which developers can write code and receive a quick response from their tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Mocha</strong> is a functional JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and browsers to make asynchronous testing easy and enjoyable. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for comprehensive and accurate reporting while mapping uncaught exceptions to the appropriate test cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Jest</strong> delivers a zero-configuration testing experience for developers. There is no need for any additional setup configuration or libraries, and it is also easy to learn for most developers. Jest is part of the Facebook open-source project group.</li>
        <li><strong>AVA</strong> is a Node.js test runner with a straightforward API, thorough error output, support for future language features, and process isolation that allows you to create with confidence.</li>
      </ul>

### What is the difference between behavior development and test drive development?

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Behavior Driven Development (BDD) aims to evaluate an application’s behavior from the end user’s perspective. In contrast, Test Driven Development (TDD) focuses on testing smaller parts of functionality in isolation.

### What Is the primary purpose/benefit of unit testing?

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> With good unit tests, developers may refactor without worry, and that is, they can maintain and extend the application considerably more quickly. Because the bulk of an application's cost is in maintenance and extension, assisting in reducing such expenses can considerably influence an application's total cost of ownership (TCO).
