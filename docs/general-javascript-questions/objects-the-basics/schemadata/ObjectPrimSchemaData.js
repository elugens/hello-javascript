      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The three variants of type conversion include string, number, and default conversions. String conversion can happen explicitly when an object expects a string, and mathematical operations use explicit number conversion on primitives. In rare circumstances where the operator is unclear about what type to anticipate, the default gets used.',
