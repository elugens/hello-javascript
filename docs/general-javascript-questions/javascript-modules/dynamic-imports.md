### Why use dynamic imports instead of static imports?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Dynamic imports are used when you want to load a module conditionally or on-demand, whereas static imports load all modules upfront, which may not be necessary and can impact performance.<br />

### How can we import a module dynamically, on-demand?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> We can implement dynamic imports by using the import expression. The import(module) expression loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It gets called from any place in our code.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// üìÅ say.js
export function hi() {
  alert(`Hello`);
}

export function bye() {
  alert(`Bye`);
}

// Then dynamic import can be like this

let { hi, bye } = await import('./say.js');

hi();
bye();
```

  </div>

### Is there a process for importing dynamic JS modules to manage issues?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To manage issues with dynamic imports, use error handling mechanisms such as the 'catch' method on the returned promise or a try-catch block with async/await to handle exceptions during module loading.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

**Error handling:**

```js
import('path/to/module.js')
  .then(module => {
    // Use module.exports
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error loading module:', error);
  });
```

**Or using async/await:**

```js
async function loadModule() {
  try {
    const module = await import('path/to/module.js');
    // Use module.exports
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading module:', error);
  }
}
loadModule();
```

### What are the benefits of the dynamic import expression in JS?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Dynamic import benefits include on-demand module loading, reduced initial load time, improved application performance, code splitting, better resource management, conditional module loading, and compatibility with lazy-loading techniques.
</div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The main benefit of dynamic imports is that they allow you to load JavaScript modules dynamically. This implementation makes it useful for lazy-loading or computed module specifier strings. In addition, dynamic imports provide us with a promise, allowing access to the .then and .catch methods for handling (catch error). Dynamic imports work in regular scripts; they don‚Äôt require script type="module".

### Is a dynamic import expression the same as a JavaScript function?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, A dynamic import expression is not the same as a JavaScript function. It's a language feature that returns a promise to load a module, whereas functions are reusable blocks of code.
</div>
  </div>

### What is tree shaking?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Tree shaking is an optimization technique in JavaScript, where bundlers like Webpack or Rollup eliminate dead or unused code from the final bundle, reducing its size and improving performance.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Tree shaking is a type of dead code removal. It implies that unnecessary modules get excluded from the bundle during the build process. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax ( i.e., import and export). Initially, the ES2015 module bundler 'rollup' promoted this. We have access to several module bundlers, including WebPack, Browserify, Fusebox, and Rollup.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Tree shaking is a build-time process, so a code example is not applicable. However, here's an example of how to enable tree shaking in Webpack (version 4+) by configuring the webpack.config.js file:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production', // Enables tree shaking by default
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

By setting the `mode` to `production`, Webpack automatically enables tree shaking, eliminating unused exports from the final bundle.

### How can you use dynamic imports with multiple modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can use Promise.all() to load multiple modules concurrently, which resolves when all modules are imported, or use multiple dynamic imports sequentially based on application requirements.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
