### What is a JavaScript module?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A JavaScript module is a reusable piece of code encapsulating functionality, which can be exported and imported by other modules using import and export statements.
</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> A module is just a file where the script resides. Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one. The export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module, and import allows the import of functionality from other modules.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// we have a file sayHi.js exporting a function:
// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// Then another file may import and use it:
import { sayHi } from './sayHi.js';

alert(sayHi); // function...
sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
```

### Do JavaScript modules work with the standard local file:// protocol?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, if you try to open a web page locally, via file:// protocol, you find that import/export directives do not work. JavaScript modules don't work with the file:// protocol due to CORS restrictions. To use modules locally, you need to set up a local web server or use a development environment.
</div><br /><br />

:::note
We can use a local web server, such as static-server, or use the live server capability of your editor, such as VS Code Live Server Extension, to test modules.

### Why should you use modules in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Modules promote modularity, maintainability, and reusability, while helping to organize code, prevent naming conflicts, and manage dependencies in large-scale applications.<br />
  </div>
  </div>

### How do you create a module in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To create a module, write code in a separate file and export the desired functionality using the export keyword. Then, import it using the import keyword.<br />
  </div>

**Here's a simple example of a JavaScript module:**

**greetings.js** (Our module file)

```javascript
export function sayHello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

**main.js** (File where we import and use the module)

```javascript
import { sayHello } from './greetings.js';

console.log(sayHello('JavaScript')); // Outputs: Hello, JavaScript!
```

  </div>
</details>

### What is different in modules compared to regular scripts?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Modules have their own scope, preventing global namespace pollution, and use import/export statements for dependencies. They are also executed in strict mode and have top-level await support.<br /><br />
  Each module has a separate top-level scope. Top-level variables, methods, and functions from a module, in general, are not visible in other scripts.<br /><br />
  The import.meta object contains information about the current module. The surroundings determine its content. The browser includes the URL of the script or if it is inside HTML, the URL of the current webpage.<br /><br />
  In top-level modules, this is undefined.<br /><br />
  Module scripts always defer, same as the defer property for external and inline scripts.<br /><br />
  For non-module scripts, the async attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document. For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.

### Can you use undeclared variables in JavaScript modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, JavaScript modules run in strict mode by default, so using undeclared variables will result in a ReferenceError. Variables must be declared with var, let, or const.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<script type="module">
  a = 5;
  // results in a ¬†syntax error
</script>
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What does module-level scope mean in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Module-level scope in JavaScript means that variables, functions, and classes declared within a module are not automatically added to the global scope and are only accessible within the module.
</div><br/>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It means that each module has its top-level scope. Top-level variables, methods, and functions from a module, in general, are not visible in other scripts. Modules expect to exportation. They want to be accessible from the outside and import what they need. In the browser, independent top-level scope also exists for each &#8249;script type="module"&#8250;.
</div>
  </div>

### Is a module imported into multiple places re-evaluated each time it gets imported?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, a module is evaluated only once, even when imported into multiple places. The same module instance is shared across all imports, ensuring consistent behavior and state.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// üìÅ alert.js
alert("Module is evaluated!");

// Import the same module from different files

// üìÅ 1.js
import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!

// üìÅ 2.js
import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)

```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What does the JavaScript import.meta object do?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The import.meta object provides metadata about the current module, such as its URL. It can be used to access context-specific information within the module's script.
</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The import.meta object exposes context-specific metadata to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the module, like the module's URL. The syntax consists of the keyword import, a dot, and the identifier meta. Typically the left-hand side of the dot is the object on which property access gets performed, but here the import is not an object.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<strong>Syntax: </strong> import.meta<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
<script type='module'>
  // returns script url - url of the html page for an inline script
  alert(import.meta.url);
</script>
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Is there anything specific that we should remember about the ‚Äúthis‚Äù keyword in JavaScript modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, in a module, top-level ‚Äúthis‚Äù is undefined. Compared to non-module scripts, where "this" is a global object.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
<script>
  alert(this); // window
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(this); // undefined
</script>

```

  </div>
  </div>

### How are module scripts loaded in the browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Module scripts are loaded in the browser using a script tag with type="module" attribute. They are fetched with CORS enabled and executed asynchronously by default.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Module scripts always defer, the same effect as the defer attribute for external and inline scripts. In other words, downloading external module scripts &#8249;script type="module" src="..."&#8250; does not block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources. The module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run. The relative order of scripts gets preserved: scripts that appear first in the document executes first. Module scripts, as a consequence, always "view" the fully loaded HTML document, including HTML components beneath them.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<script type="module">
  alert(typeof button); // object: the script can 'see' the button below // as
  modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded
</script>
```

  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Compare to regular script below:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<script>
  alert(typeof button); // button is undefined, the script can't see elements below

  // regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed
</script>

<button id="button">Button</button>
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the difference between inline asynchronous scripts and a module?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Inline asynchronous scripts use the async attribute on a script tag, executing them asynchronously without module features. Modules have their own scope, import/export syntax, and always execute asynchronously.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
<!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
<script async type="module">
  import { counter } from './analytics.js';

  counter.count();
</script>
```

  </div>
  </div>

### Can you explain how external scripts with type="module" are different from scripts without it?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Scripts with type="module" are ES6 modules with support for imports/exports. They run in strict mode, have a separate scope, and load asynchronously. Scripts without it are classic scripts with global scope.
</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> External scripts with the type="module" attribute differ in two ways. For starters, external scripts with the same src only run once. Second, Cross-Origin Requests, external scripts that get requested from a different origin (for example, another site) require CORS headers.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
<script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
// r
<script type="module" src="my.js"></script>

<!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->
<!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->
<script type="module" src="http://another-site.com/their.js"></script>
```

:::note
If a module script gets fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header Access-Control-Allow-Origin allowing the fetch. That ensures better security by default.

### In node.js bare modules are common, are bare modules allowed in browser imports?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, The import must be given a relative or absolute URL in the browser. They  are not allowed in browser imports as they require a resolver to locate the file. Browser imports use relative or absolute URLs to specify the module's location. Modules that do not have a url path get defined as "bare" modules, and such modules get blocked for import.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
import { sayHi } from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module
// the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is
```

:::note
Certain environments, such as Node.js or bundle tools, allow bare modules with no path since they have methods of identifying modules and hooks to fine-tune them. However, browsers do not currently allow bare modules.

### What is the fallback script type for older browsers for JavaScript modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Old browsers do not understand type="module". Scripts of an unknown type just get ignored. For them, it is possible to provide a fallback using the nomodule attribute.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<script type="module">
  alert('Runs in modern browsers');
</script>

<script nomodule>
  alert('Modern browsers know both type=module and nomodule, so skip this');
  alert(
    'Old browsers ignore script with unknown type=module, but execute this.'
  );
</script>
```

### What is a circular dependency in modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A circular dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other, either directly or indirectly, which can lead to unintended behaviors or errors in the application.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How can you handle circular dependencies?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Circular dependencies can be resolved by refactoring the code to remove the circularity, using an intermediary module to break the loop, or utilizing dynamic imports to delay loading.<br />
  </div>
  </div>

### What are the benefits of using ES modules over CommonJS modules?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> ES modules have better support for static analysis, tree shaking, and native browser support, making them more suitable for modern web development compared to CommonJS modules.<br />
  </div>
