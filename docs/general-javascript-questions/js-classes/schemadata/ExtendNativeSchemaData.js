        text: 'Built-in methods like an array, filter, map, and others return new objects of the inherited type. Their internal implementation uses the objectâ€™s constructor property for that.

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'The symbol Symbol.species specifies a function-valued property that the constructor function uses to create derived objects. Subclasses can override the default constructor for objects using the species accessor attribute. Symbol.species gets used when you may want to return Array objects in your derived array class. When utilizing methods that return the default constructor, such as map(), you want these methods to return a parent Array object rather than the extending object.',
