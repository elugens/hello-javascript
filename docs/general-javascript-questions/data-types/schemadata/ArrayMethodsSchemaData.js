The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

It returns a new array with all entries from index start to finish copied to it (not including end). When both start and end are negative, the position from the array end is assumed. It works similarly to the string function str.slice, except instead of substrings, it creates subarrays. We can also use it without arguments: arr.slice() which duplicates arr.

We define what happens in that callback function. You should note that forEach expects a synchronous function and does not wait for promises. The forEach should not get used like a for or for..of loop on large data sets. It can cause bottlenecks because you cannot directly break out of the loop using a break statement other than throwing an exception.

It becomes clear that there are times when it would be helpful for JavaScript code to manipulate raw binary data easily. This point is the time where typed arrays come in. Each entry in a JavaScript typed array is a raw binary value in one of several supported formats, from 8-bit integers to 64-bit floating-point numbers.<br /><br /> However, typed arrays are not to be confused with standard arrays, as calling Array.isArray() on a typed array returns false. Moreover, not all methods available for standard arrays get supported by typed arrays (e.g., push and pop).<br /><br /> JavaScript typed arrays divide the implementation into buffers and views for optimal flexibility and efficiency. A buffer (implemented by the ArrayBuffer object) is an object that represents a block of data; it has no format and no way to retrieve its contents. A view is required to access the memory contained in a buffer. A view, which turns the data into a typed array, provides a context: a data type, beginning offset, and the number of elements.',
