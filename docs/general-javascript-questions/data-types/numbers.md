### In JavaScript, What is the Number object?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Number object is a built-in object in JavaScript that represents numerical values and provides methods for working with numbers.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In JavaScript, the Number object is a wrapper object that allows you to work with numerical values. The Number object can be created using the Number() constructor, but it's often not necessary because JavaScript automatically converts number literals and variables to instances of the Number object when necessary.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
let num = new Number(10);
```

However, you generally don't need to explicitly create Number objects in this way. Instead, you can just work with number primitives, like so:

```javascript
let num = 10;
```

JavaScript will automatically convert `num` to a Number object when you call methods on it. For example:

```javascript
let num = 10;
console.log(num.toFixed(2)); // "10.00"
```

In this case, JavaScript temporarily converts the number primitive `10` to a Number object so that the `toFixed` method can be used.

The Number object also has properties for numerical constants, such as `Number.MAX_VALUE`, `Number.MIN_VALUE`, `Number.NaN` (representing "Not a Number"), `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, and `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.

Finally, note that while the Number object is useful, using number primitives is generally more efficient. You should avoid using the Number constructor unless necessary because creating Number objects can slow down execution speed.

### What are the two primitive number data types in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> There are two primitive number data types including Number for integers and floating-point values, and BigInt for arbitrarily large integers.
</div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### In what format are regular numbers stored in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript stores regular numbers using the double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754, which represents floating-point numbers and integers within its range.
</div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you explain the limitations of BigInt in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> BigInt has some limitations, including an inability to mix with regular numbers in operations, incompatibility with some built-in methods like Math functions, and a lack of support in JSON.
</div>
  </div>

### In JavaScript, Is there a safe way to separate large number groups like 1,000,000,000 and maintain a formal format?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, we can use an underscore to ensure that the number maintains its primitive format.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The most common way to safely separate number groups without using a comma (which would cause an error) and keep its primitive format. We use an underscore (syntactic sugar) to ensure that the number maintains its primitive format. However, there are easier ways to propagate large numbers in most programming languages.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let billion = 1_000_000_000;
console.log(typeof billion); // returns number and maintains its primitive

let billions = 2,000,000,000;
console.log(typeof billons) // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected number
```

  </div>
  </div>

### What is the most straightforward approach to avoid writing large numerical sequences like 1,000,000,000?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To avoid writing large numerical sequences, we can use e-notation (1e9 for 1,000,000,000) or store the value in a variable with a descriptive name.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let billion = 1e9;  // 1 billion, literally: 1 and 9 zeroes

console.log( 7.3e9 );  // 7.3 billions (same as 7300000000 or 7_300_000_000)

// In other words, e multiplies the number by 1 with the given zeroes count.

// 1e3 = 1 * 1000 // e3 means *1000
// 1.23e6 = 1.23 * 1000000 // e6 means *1000000

// Now let’s write something very small as a regular number.
// Say, 1 microsecond (one millionth of a second):

let ms = 0.000001;

// Using "e" can help. If we’d like to avoid writing the zeroes explicitly

let ms = 1e-6; // six zeroes to the left from 1

```

  </div>

### Can you explain what the exponential notation is used for in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Exponential notation or e-notation is used to represent very large or very small numbers more concisely, by using a shortened form of scientific notation, using "e" to indicate the power of 10.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### In exponential notation, What happens when the minus sign precedes a number in JavaScript, and how does it affect numbers expressed?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript, placing a minus sign before a number negates its value. When used with numbers in exponential notation, it negates the exponent, effectively making the number smaller if it was positive, or larger if it was negative.
  <br /><br />
  <p><strong>For example, -1e3 is equivalent to -1000 or 1e-3 is equivalent to 0.001</strong></p>
</div>
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
console.log(1e-9); // 1e-9 is 0.000000001; the minus sign applies to the exponent

console.log(-1e9); // -1e9 is - 1000000000.0; minus sign applies to the number itself.
```

  </div>

### Which numeral systems are utilized in JavaScript for character encoding, color representation, and base representation purposes?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript uses the UTF-16 encoding for character representation, hexadecimal notation for color representation, and supports base 10 and base 16 (hexadecimal) representation of numbers.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
console.log(0xff); // 255
console.log(0xFF); // 255 (the same, case doesn't matter)

// Binary and octal numeral systems

let a = 0b11111111; // binary form of 255
let b = 0o377; // octal form of 255

console.log(a == b); // true, the same number 255 at both sides
```

### What is the difference between Number.isNaN() and isNaN()?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript, Number.isNaN() strictly checks if a value is NaN, while isNaN() first attempts to convert the value to a number, resulting in potential type coercion and false positives. Therefore, Number.isNaN() is more reliable for checking if a value is NaN.
  </div>
  </div>
