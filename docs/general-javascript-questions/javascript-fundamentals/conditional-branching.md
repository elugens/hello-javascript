### What is an if statement in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> An if statement is a conditional statement that checks a specified condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the if statement is ignored.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 published?', '');
if (year == 2015) alert('You are right!'); // You are right!
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you execute more than one statement in an if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, but they must be encased in curly brackets {}. Even if just one sentence has to run, this improves readability and is encouraged.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
if (year == 2015) {
  alert("That's correct!");
  alert("You're so smart!");
}
```

  </div>
  </div>

### What is conditional branching in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Conditional branching in JavaScript involves using statements like 'if', 'else', and 'else if' to execute specific code blocks depending on whether certain conditions are met, allowing for dynamic behavior.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you execute more than one statement in an if statement?

<details>s
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can execute multiple statements within an if statement by enclosing them in curly braces ({}) to form a block. This lets you perform various actions based on a single condition.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What type of conversion does the JavaScript “if” statement use?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The JavaScript "if" statement uses implicit type coercion, converting the condition to a boolean value. This is done through the Abstract Equality Comparison algorithm, often called "loose" comparison.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you pre-evaluate a condition for use in an if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can pre-evaluate a condition by assigning its result to a variable and then using that variable as the condition in the if statement.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let cond = year == 2015; // equality evaluates to true or false
if (cond) {
  alert('Hello, World'); // returns Hello, World
}
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Is there a way to handle false conditions in an if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, We can use an if-else statement to handle false conditions.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Yes, the “if” statement may contain an optional “else” block. It executes when the condition is false.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 published?', '');

if (year == 2015) {
  alert('You guessed it right!');
} else {
  alert('How can you be so wrong?'); // any value except 2015
}
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### If you want to test a variety of circumstances. What kind of conditional statement can you use with an if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To test various circumstances, you can use "else if" clauses along with the "if" statement, creating a chain of conditions to check before executing a specific code block.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015  published?', '');

if (year < 2015) {
  alert('Too early...');
} else if (year > 2015) {
  alert('Too late');
} else {
  alert('Exactly!');
}
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you assign a variable depending on a condition in an if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, in JavaScript you can assign a variable depending on a condition in an if statement.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

if (age > 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}

alert(accessAllowed);
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Is there a shorthand version of the if statement that you can use in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript offers a shorthand version called the ternary operator (condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression) for simple if-else statements, allowing for concise inline conditional evaluations.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// the comparison operator "age > 18" executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;
```

  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Note:</strong> Because the comparison itself gives true/false, you may eliminate using the question mark operator in the above example:<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// the same
let accessAllowed = age > 18;
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the syntax of an if statement in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript, the syntax for an if statement starts with the keyword 'if', followed by a condition in parentheses. Then, code blocks for true and optional false conditions are enclosed in curly braces.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the else keyword used for in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The "else" keyword is used in conjunction with an "if" statement to provide an alternative code block to execute when the condition of the "if" statement is false.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is a switch statement in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A switch statement is a control structure used to execute different code blocks based on the value of a specified expression, simplifying multiple if-else conditions.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the syntax of a switch statement in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The switch statement syntax includes the 'switch' keyword, followed by an expression that is compared to values in each "case" block. When a match is found, the code in the corresponding block is executed. Optionally, a 'default' clause is added.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise, shorthand way to write simple if-else statements.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can multiple conditions be combined in a single if statement?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, multiple conditions can be combined in a single if statement using logical operators such as '&&' (AND), '||' (OR), and '!' (NOT) to create complex conditionals.</div><br/>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How many conditional branching methods does JavaScript have?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript has three primary conditional branching methods: if-else statements, switch statements, and the ternary operator, each serving different use cases and levels of complexity.</div><br/>
  </div>
