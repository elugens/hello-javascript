### Can you explain what the global object is in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The global object in JavaScript is a top-level container for global variables, functions, and objects. It's automatically created and accessible throughout the entire code, with 'window' in browsers and 'global' in Node.js.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
alert('Hello');
// is the same as
window.alert('Hello');

var foo = 'foobar';
foo === window.foo; // Returns: true

function greeting() {
  console.log('Hi!');
}

window.greeting(); // It is the same as the normal invoking: greeting();

// The global function greeting was stored in the window object, like this:
greeting: function greeting() {
  console.log('Hi!');
}
```

:::note

(In Node.js, this is not the case.) The global object's interface depends on the execution context in which the script is running.

### How should you use JavaScript's global (window) object?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
   <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You should use JavaScript's global (window) object sparingly by avoiding the creation of global variables and functions, which can cause naming conflicts and make code harder to maintain. Instead, utilize local scope, closures, and JavaScript modules to organize and separate code.
  </div><br />
   <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> It is typically discouraged to use global variables, which gets kept to a minimum. The code design in which a function receives "input" variables and generates a specific "result" is more straightforward, less prone to mistakes, and simpler to verify than the code design in which external or global variables get used. The global object gets used to test for support of contemporary language features. This approach is typical in Polyfills to guarantee that user interaction results in an equitable response.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
if (!window.Promise) {
  alert("Your browser is really old!");
}

if (!window.Promise) {
  window.Promise = ... // custom implementation of the modern language feature
}
```

### How does the Global Object differ between a browser environment and a Node.js environment?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In a browser, the Global Object is window, whereas in Node.js, it's global. The properties and methods differ accordingly; e.g., window.alert() in browsers, global.require() in Node.js.<br /><br />
  </div>
  </div>

### Can you explain the difference between the 'window', 'self', and 'globalThis' properties in a browser context?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In a browser context, 'window' represents the global object for web pages, 'self' refers to the current context (Window or Worker), and 'globalThis' unifies global objects across different environments, ensuring compatibility.<br /><br />
  </div>
  </div>

### How does the Global Object store global variables and functions in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Global Object stores global variables and functions as its properties, making them accessible throughout the entire JavaScript program, regardless of the current scope or context.<br /><br />
  </div>
  </div>

### What is the significance of the 'undefined' property in the Global Object?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'undefined' property in the Global Object represents the primitive value 'undefined', used to indicate uninitialized variables, missing parameters, or non-existent properties, helping to distinguish them from actual values.<br /><br />
  </div>
  </div>

### Can you briefly explain the 'eval()' function in the Global Object, and why it is considered unsafe to use in most cases?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'eval()' function in the Global Object executes a string of code as JavaScript. It is considered unsafe as it can execute arbitrary code and cause security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.<br /><br />
  </div>
  </div>

### How can you access the Global Object in different JavaScript environments?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In a browser environment, the Global Object is accessed using 'window' or 'self', while in Node.js it is accessed using 'global'. The 'globalThis' property can be used in both.<br /><br />

### What are some best practices when working with the Global Object to avoid conflicts and issues in your code?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Best practices to avoid issues with the Global Object include avoiding the creation of global variables and functions, using local scope and closures, leveraging JavaScript modules, and accessing built-in methods when necessary. Also, consider using a linter or strict mode.<br /><br />

### Can you discuss the role of the Global Object in JavaScript's module system and how it affects the scope of variables and functions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript's module system, each module has its own scope, and variables and functions are not automatically added to the Global Object. This improves code organization and reduces naming conflicts. Modules can expose their functionality using exports.<br /><br />
