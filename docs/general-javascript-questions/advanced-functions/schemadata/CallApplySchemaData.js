        text: "When are CPU-heavy functions return the same result consistently. You can use transparent caching to reduce the user's browser or server load by implementing a decorator. The decorator handles the function's result to determine if the result gets cached or not. Transparent caching also reduces the bandwidth necessary to perform tasks and can significantly improve application performance. One of the main benefits of creating decorators is the ability to re-use cached results.",

        text: "A decorator is a function that modifies the function's behavior or method passed to it by returning a new function. You can implement decorators in any language that supports functions as first-class citizens. You can bind a function to a variable or pass it as an argument to another function.",

The call() method provides a new " this " value to the function/method. You can use the "call" method to write a method once and then inherit it in another object without having to rewrite the method for the new object. The call method expects a list of parameters, whereas the apply method expects an array of arguments.',
