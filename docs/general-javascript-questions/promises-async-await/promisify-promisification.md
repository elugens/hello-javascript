### What is Promisification in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promisification in JavaScript is the process of converting callback-based functions into Promise-based functions, enabling easier handling of asynchronous operations and improved code flow management.
</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> “Promisification” is a long word for a simple transformation, and it is the conversion of a function that accepts a callback into a function that returns a promise. Such transformations are often required in real-life, as many functions and libraries are callback-based. But promises are more convenient, so it makes sense to “promisify” them.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
let loadScriptPromise = function (src) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    loadScript(src, (err, script) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(script);
    });
  });
};

// usage:
// loadScriptPromise('path/script.js').then(...)
```

  </div>

### Why do we need Promisification?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promisification simplifies asynchronous code, helps avoid callback hell, and allows for better error handling and chaining of asynchronous operations using Promise chaining or async/await.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is a Promise in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, allowing developers to attach callbacks to handle results or errors.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does Promisification relate to async/await?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promisification enables using async/await by converting callback-based functions into Promise-based functions, making it possible to use async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the purpose of the resolve and reject functions in a Promise constructor?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In a Promise constructor, `resolve` and `reject` are functions used to signal the Promise's outcome. `resolve` fulfills the promise with a value, while `reject` indicates the promise failed with a reason.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does error propagation work in Promisification?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In promisification, errors are propagated through the promise chain. If an error is thrown or a promise is rejected, it is passed down to the next `catch` or `then` handler with a rejection callback.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is a common pattern for Promisifying a function with a single callback?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A common pattern is to create a function that returns a new Promise. The executor function of the Promise wraps the original callback-based function and calls `resolve` or `reject` in the callback.<br />
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
function promisifiedFunction(params) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    originalFunction(params, (error, result) => {
      if (error) {
        reject(error);
      } else {
        resolve(result);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

This promisified function can now be used with `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `async/await`.

### How does Promise.all() help in Promisification?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promise.all() is a method that takes an iterable of Promises and returns a new Promise that is fulfilled with an array of fulfilled values, in the order they were passed. It simplifies handling multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the role of Promise.prototype.finally() in Promisification?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promise.prototype.finally() is a method that allows attaching a callback that is executed when the Promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected). It's useful for cleanup or finalizing tasks, regardless of the Promise outcome.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you Promisify functions with multiple callbacks?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can Promisify functions with multiple callbacks by creating a new function that returns a Promise and managing each callback using separate resolve/reject functions, or by using Promise.all() to handle multiple Promises concurrently.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does Promisification improve error handling?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promisification enables chaining .catch() or using try/catch blocks with async/await, centralizing error handling and making it easier to manage errors in a consistent and organized way.<br />
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### How do you handle timeouts in Promisified functions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can handle timeouts by using Promise.race() to race the Promisified function against a timeout Promise that rejects with a custom error after a specified duration, ensuring the operation is limited to a given time-frame.<br />
  </div>
  </div>

### What is one crucial aspect to remember when using promisifications?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Promisification is an excellent approach, especially when using async/await, but not a total replacement for callbacks. Remember, a promise may have only one result, but a callback may technically be called many times. So promisification is only meant for functions that call the callback once, and further calls get ignored.
