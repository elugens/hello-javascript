### Can you explain the constructor design pattern?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>

  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor design pattern is a creational pattern that provides a standardized way to create objects by defining a common constructor interface. It can help simplify object creation and initialization.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The constructor pattern is a design pattern that uses a class or function to create unique types of objects. A constructor is a one-of-a-kind method for initializing a newly created object after allocated memory.<br/><br/>Constructor patterns are among the most fundamental, extensively used, and modern JavaScript patterns. The objective of this pattern, as hinted by the name, is to facilitate constructor creation.

### When should you use the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor pattern is useful when you need to create multiple instances of an object with similar properties and behavior, and when you want to encapsulate related data and behavior within a single object.

### What are some of the issues related to constructor pattern and instance checking?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> When building constructors, you should be aware of object duplication resulting in a new instance. The repetition can be caused by using methods when building prototypes and returning false results when checking instance equality.
    </div><br />

  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function Phone(brand, model, countryDesignedIn, countryMadein) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.model = model;
  this.countryDesignedIn = countryDesignedIn;
  this.countryMadein = countryMadein;

  this.toString = function () {
    return `${this.brand} ${this.model} manufactured in ${this.countryMadein}`;
  };
}

Phone.prototype.toStringAlt = function () {
  return `${this.brand} ${this.model} designed in ${this.countryDesignedIn}`;
};

yourPhone = new Phone('Nokia', '3310', 'Denmark', 'Denmark');
myPhone = new Phone('iPhone', '7', 'USA', 'China');

// Test if toString method works
console.log(yourPhone.toString()); // Output: Nokia 3310 manufactured in Denmark
console.log(myPhone.toString()); // Output: iPhone 7 manufactured in China

// Test if toString function are not duplicated (let's say the same object)
console.log(
  `toString functions are the same object: ${
    yourPhone.toString === myPhone.toString
  }`
);

// Test if toStringAlt method works
console.log(yourPhone.toStringAlt()); // Output: Nokia 3310 designed in Denmark
console.log(myPhone.toStringAlt()); // Output: iPhone 7 designed in USA

// Test if toStringAlt function are not duplicated (let's say the same object)
console.log(
  `toStringAlt functions are the same object: ${
    yourPhone.toStringAlt === myPhone.toStringAlt
  }`
);
// Output: toStringAlt functions are the same object: true

// Checking Instance Equality
console.log(yourPhone === myPhone); // false
```

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The drawbacks of using the constructor pattern in JavaScript include potential performance issues with creating many instances, and the lack of true private properties and methods.

### What differentiates the constructor pattern from the prototype pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The primary difference between the constructor and prototype pattern is the reusability of components.
    </div><br />
    <strong>Constructor Pattern:</strong><br />
    When you create a new constructor, it creates a new instance of everything, and any changes made to the instantiated object do not affect the others.<br /><br />
    <strong>Prototype Pattern:</strong><br />
    Creating a new object using the prototype reuses the logic, and any change to the prototype chain affects everyone else.
