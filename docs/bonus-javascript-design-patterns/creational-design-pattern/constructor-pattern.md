### What is the constructor design pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor pattern is a creational design pattern in JavaScript that allows creating multiple instances of an object using a constructor function, with each instance sharing properties and methods.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The constructor pattern is a design pattern that uses a class or function to create unique types of objects. A constructor is a one-of-a-kind method for initializing a newly created object after allocated memory.<br/><br/>Constructor patterns are among the most fundamental, extensively used, and modern JavaScript patterns. The objective of this pattern, as hinted by the name, is to facilitate constructor creation.

### What are some of the issues related to constructor pattern and instance checking?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript's dynamic typing can cause issues with instance checking. An object created by a constructor might not be recognized as an instance of it, especially when inheritance or different contexts are involved.
    </div><br />

  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function Phone(brand, model, countryDesignedIn, countryMadein) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.model = model;
  this.countryDesignedIn = countryDesignedIn;
  this.countryMadein = countryMadein;

  this.toString = function () {
    return `${this.brand} ${this.model} manufactured in ${this.countryMadein}`;
  };
}

Phone.prototype.toStringAlt = function () {
  return `${this.brand} ${this.model} designed in ${this.countryDesignedIn}`;
};

yourPhone = new Phone('Nokia', '3310', 'Denmark', 'Denmark');
myPhone = new Phone('iPhone', '7', 'USA', 'China');

// Test if toString method works
console.log(yourPhone.toString()); // Output: Nokia 3310 manufactured in Denmark
console.log(myPhone.toString()); // Output: iPhone 7 manufactured in China

// Test if toString function are not duplicated (let's say the same object)
console.log(
  `toString functions are the same object: ${
    yourPhone.toString === myPhone.toString
  }`
);

// Test if toStringAlt method works
console.log(yourPhone.toStringAlt()); // Output: Nokia 3310 designed in Denmark
console.log(myPhone.toStringAlt()); // Output: iPhone 7 designed in USA

// Test if toStringAlt function are not duplicated (let's say the same object)
console.log(
  `toStringAlt functions are the same object: ${
    yourPhone.toStringAlt === myPhone.toStringAlt
  }`
);
// Output: toStringAlt functions are the same object: true

// Checking Instance Equality
console.log(yourPhone === myPhone); // false
```

### What are the benefits of using the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor pattern promotes reusability and encapsulation. It's efficient for creating multiple instances of an object with the same structure and behavior, providing consistency and organization.
    </div><br />
    </div>

### What are the drawbacks of using the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor pattern can be memory inefficient, as each instance gets its own copy of methods. It can also have issues with instance recognition when inheritance is involved.
    </div><br />

### How do the constructor pattern and prototype pattern differ?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The primary difference between the constructor and prototype pattern is the reusability of components. The constructor pattern creates new objects with each instance having its own methods. The prototype pattern uses a shared prototype to conserve memory, where all instances share a common set of methods.
    </div><br />
    <strong>Constructor Pattern:</strong><br />
    When you create a new constructor, it creates a new instance of everything, and any changes made to the instantiated object do not affect the others.<br /><br />
    <strong>Prototype Pattern:</strong><br />
    Creating a new object using the prototype reuses the logic, and any change to the prototype chain affects everyone else.
    <div>
    </div>
  </div>

### How does the new keyword work in the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'new' keyword in JavaScript creates an instance of an object type. It calls the constructor function, sets 'this' to the new object, and automatically returns the new object if the constructor doesn't explicitly.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is a downside of the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Every instance gets its own copy of methods, which can be inefficient for memory usage.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What's a way to mitigate the downside of the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A common mitigation is the use of Prototypes. Instead of defining methods inside the constructor function, they're attached to the constructor's prototype. This avoids method duplication across instances.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you modify a constructor's prototype after it has been created?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can modify a constructor's prototype after its creation. Any changes to the prototype will be immediately accessible to all instances, even those created before the changes.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can we have private variables in a constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can create private variables in a constructor pattern in JavaScript by declaring variables with the 'var' keyword inside the constructor. These won't be directly accessible outside the function.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What happens if we forget to use the new keyword with a constructor?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> If you forget to use 'new' with a constructor in JavaScript, 'this' inside the constructor will reference the global object, likely leading to unintended side effects and potential errors.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does inheritance work with the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Inheritance in the constructor pattern involves using the "call" or "apply" methods to invoke the parent constructor within the child constructor. Then the child's prototype is set to an instance of the parent.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does the constructor pattern compare to the factory pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The constructor pattern requires 'new' for object creation, provides 'instanceof' checks, but can cause issues if 'new' is forgotten. The factory pattern avoids 'new' issues, and returns objects directly, but lacks 'instanceof' checks.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is a "pseudo-classical" pattern in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The pseudo-classical pattern in JavaScript involves creating constructors, using 'new' to instantiate objects, and setting methods on the constructor's prototype, mimicking traditional class-based languages like Java.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How are static properties and methods used in the constructor pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Static properties and methods are attached directly to the constructor function, not instances. They're shared across all instances and typically used for functionality not tied to a specific instance.
  </div>
  </div>
