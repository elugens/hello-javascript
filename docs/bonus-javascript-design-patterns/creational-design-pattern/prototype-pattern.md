### Could you please explain the prototype design pattern?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype design pattern is a way of creating objects by defining a prototype object and cloning it to create new instances. It promotes code reuse and inheritance.<br/>
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> We commonly refer to an object you can clone as a prototype. The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but instead of producing uninitialized objects, it creates objects with values copied from a prototype - or example - object. The Prototype pattern is also known as the Properties pattern.<br/><br/>We can use the prototype pattern to create new objects based on its blueprint by cloning an existing object. The prototype pattern based on prototypal inheritance can use JavaScript's native prototyping capabilities.

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Client** -- In example code: _the run() function_

- creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself

**Prototype** -- In example code: _CustomerPrototype_

- creates an interfaces to clone itself

**Clones** -- In example code: _Customer_

- the cloned objects that are being created

</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
const myCar = {
  name: 'Ford Escort',

  drive() {
    console.log("Weeee. I'm driving!");
  },

  panic() {
    console.log('Wait. How do you stop this thing?');
  },
};

// Use Object.create to instantiate a new car
const yourCar = Object.create(myCar);

// Now we can see that one is a prototype of the other
console.log(yourCar.name);

const yourCarProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(yourCar);

console.log(yourCarProto === myCar); // true

/*

output:

Ford Escort
true

*/
```

### What is an example of a good use case for the prototype pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A good use case for the Prototype pattern is when creating multiple instances of an object with similar properties and methods, such as for form inputs or buttons.
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> You can use the Prototype pattern to help initialize business objects with values that match the database's default values. The prototype object contains the default values that you can copy into a newly created business object.<br/><br/>Classical languages rarely use the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript is a prototypal language that uses this pattern to construct new objects and their prototypes.<br/><br/>We should use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects you need to copy.

### What are some of the advantages of employing the Prototype pattern?

  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Advantages of the Prototype pattern in JavaScript include memory efficiency, improved performance, and easier inheritance and object creation with shared properties and methods.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the Prototype Pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- We can clone an object without being bound to its concrete classes.
- You can avoid repeating the initialization code by cloning pre-built prototypes.
- It is easier to produce complex objects.
- When dealing with structural presets for complex objects, we produce an alternative to inheritance.

  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Disadvantages of the Prototype pattern in JavaScript include potential confusion with the 'this' keyword, less intuitive code compared to class-based patterns, and the potential for circular references leading to memory leaks and unpredictable behavior.<br />

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Alternatives to the Prototype pattern in JavaScript include the Class pattern, Factory pattern, and Constructor pattern, which provide different approaches to object creation and inheritance.<br />
