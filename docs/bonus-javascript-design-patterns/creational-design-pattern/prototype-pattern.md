### What is the Prototype Design Pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>

  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype pattern involves creating new objects by cloning existing ones, instead of using constructors. It promotes code reuse and inheritance.<br/>
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> We commonly refer to an object you can clone as a prototype. The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but instead of producing uninitialized objects, it creates objects with values copied from a prototype - or example - object. The Prototype pattern is also known as the Properties pattern.<br/><br/>We can use the prototype pattern to create new objects based on its blueprint by cloning an existing object. The prototype pattern based on prototypal inheritance can use JavaScript's native prototyping capabilities.

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Client** -- In example code: _the run() function_

- creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself

**Prototype** -- In example code: _CustomerPrototype_

- creates an interfaces to clone itself

**Clones** -- In example code: _Customer_

- the cloned objects that are being created

</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
const myCar = {
  name: 'Ford Escort',

  drive() {
    console.log("Weeee. I'm driving!");
  },

  panic() {
    console.log('Wait. How do you stop this thing?');
  },
};

// Use Object.create to instantiate a new car
const yourCar = Object.create(myCar);

// Now we can see that one is a prototype of the other
console.log(yourCar.name);

const yourCarProto = Object.getPrototypeOf(yourCar);

console.log(yourCarProto === myCar); // true

/*

output:

Ford Escort
true

*/
```

### The Prototype pattern belongs to which design pattern family?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype pattern belongs to the creational design pattern family, which deals with object creation mechanisms.

### What is an example of a good use case for the prototype pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype pattern is useful when object creation is costly, and you need to duplicate existing instances, retaining their state, especially in performance-intensive situations like gaming or graphics rendering.
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> You can use the Prototype pattern to help initialize business objects with values that match the database's default values. The prototype object contains the default values that you can copy into a newly created business object.<br/><br/>Classical languages rarely use the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript is a prototypal language that uses this pattern to construct new objects and their prototypes.<br/><br/>We should use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects you need to copy.

### What are some of the advantages of employing the Prototype pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype pattern enables fast object cloning, reducing system overhead. It promotes flexibility over hardcoded classes, facilitates adding and removing objects at runtime, and simplifies complex object creation, thus improving performance and memory utilization.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the Prototype Pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- We can clone an object without being bound to its concrete classes.
- You can avoid repeating the initialization code by cloning pre-built prototypes.
- It is easier to produce complex objects.
- When dealing with structural presets for complex objects, we produce an alternative to inheritance.

  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Disadvantages include difficulty handling cloning for objects with circular references, risks of Prototype Pollution, and potentially confusing behavior for developers unfamiliar with prototypal inheritance.<br />

### In JavaScript, Are there any alternatives to using the prototype pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, alternatives include the Factory pattern for creating objects, the Constructor pattern for initializing new objects, or ES6 classes that handle prototypal inheritance under the hood.<br />

### Why would you use the Prototype Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Prototype Pattern is used when creating many identical objects quickly. It's useful when instantiation is expensive and you want to avoid duplicate database calls or run-time computation.

### Why is the Prototype Design Pattern important in JavaScript, unlike in other languages?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript utilizes prototypal inheritance, making the Prototype Design Pattern integral. It enables object creation by cloning existing ones, leveraging JavaScript's native prototype-based architecture.
