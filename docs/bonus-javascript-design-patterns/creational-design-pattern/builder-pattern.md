### What is the Builder Design Pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The builder design pattern is a "creational" design pattern that separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing for flexible and easy object creation.<br/><br/>
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Builders allow us to construct complex objects by only specifying the type and content of the object, shielding us from the process of creating or representing the object explicitly.<br/><br/>
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Diagram:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Director** -- In example code: _Shop_

- uses the Builder's multi-step interface to build products

**Builder** -- _JavaScript does not use it._

- asserts a multi-step interface for the creation of a complex product

**ConcreteBuilder** -- In example code: _CarBuilder_ and _TruckBuilder_ are two examples of code.

- Implements the Builder interface with multiple steps
- Maintains the product's integrity during the assembly process
- offers the ability to retrieve the newly created product

**Products** -- In example code: _Car, Truck_

- represents the complicated objects that must get assembled

<br />

</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
function Shop() {
  this.construct = function (builder) {
    builder.step1();
    builder.step2();
    return builder.get();
  };
}

function CarBuilder() {
  this.car = null;

  this.step1 = function () {
    this.car = new Car();
  };

  this.step2 = function () {
    this.car.addParts();
  };

  this.get = function () {
    return this.car;
  };
}

function TruckBuilder() {
  this.truck = null;

  this.step1 = function () {
    this.truck = new Truck();
  };

  this.step2 = function () {
    this.truck.addParts();
  };

  this.get = function () {
    return this.truck;
  };
}

function Car() {
  this.doors = 0;

  this.addParts = function () {
    this.doors = 4;
  };

  this.say = function () {
    console.log('I am a ' + this.doors + '-door car');
  };
}

function Truck() {
  this.doors = 0;

  this.addParts = function () {
    this.doors = 2;
  };

  this.say = function () {
    console.log('I am a ' + this.doors + '-door truck');
  };
}

function run() {
  let shop = new Shop();
  let carBuilder = new CarBuilder();
  let truckBuilder = new TruckBuilder();
  let car = shop.construct(carBuilder);
  let truck = shop.construct(truckBuilder);

  car.say();
  truck.say();
}

run();

/*

OUTPUT:

I am a 4-door car
I am a 2-door truck

*/
```

### Why use the Builder Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Builder Pattern enhances code readability and reduces complexity by handling complex object construction and maintaining control over object assembly.
  </div>

### What is the most common reason to use the Builder Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The most common reason to use the Builder Pattern is to create complex or composite objects with many configurable parameters, while improving code readability and maintainability.
    </div><br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The most common reason for using Builder is to make client code that creates complex objects that are simpler to comprehend. The client can still direct the Builder's actions without knowing how the actual work gets completed. Because the procedures involved are frequently repetitive and complex, builders frequently encapsulate the construction of Composite objects (another GoF design pattern).<br/><br/>It is usually the last step that returns the newly created object, making it simple for a Builder to participate in fluent interfaces where multiple method calls separated by dot operators get chained next to each other.<br/><br/>

### Can you name the objects participating in the Builder Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Director, AbstractBuilder, ConcreteBuilder, and Product are the objects participating in the Builder Pattern.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The objects participating in the Builder Pattern include the Director, Builder, ConcreteBuilder, and Products objects. The director object constructs products by using the Builder’s multi-step interface. The Builder object, not used in JavaScript, declares a multi-step interface for creating a complex product. The ConcreteBuilder implements the multi-component Builder interface, keeps the product in position during the assembly process, and enables you to retrieve the newly created product. The Products object represents the complex objects getting assembled.
    </div><br />

:::note

Though the definition particularly mentions that an interface needs to be defined, we don’t have interfaces in _Vanilla JavaScript_. Therefore, we must implement it in a way that JavaScript translates into an interface.

### Why is the AbstractBuilder Object participant not used in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript, the AbstractBuilder object participant is not commonly used because JavaScript does not have interfaces like other object-oriented programming languages. Instead, function objects are used to implement the Builder pattern.

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Some benefits of using the Builder pattern in JavaScript are: improved object creation flexibility, separation of concerns, and improved code maintainability and readability.
      </div><br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The builder pattern has several advantages, which can be summarized as follows.
      </div><br/>

<div></div>

- You may build items step by step, defer building phases, or perform them recursively.
- When creating different product representations, you can reuse the same construction code.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You may separate sophisticated building of code from the product's business logic.

### Is the Builder Pattern suitable for immutable objects? Why or why not?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>

### Can the Builder Pattern be used with prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>

---

### Can the Builder pattern be used with the Singleton Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, the Builder Pattern can be used with the Singleton Pattern. The Builder can ensure that only one instance of a complex object is created.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### When should the Builder Pattern be avoided?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It should be avoided when the object creation process is not complex, or when the object does not require multiple steps in its creation.
  </div>
  </div>
