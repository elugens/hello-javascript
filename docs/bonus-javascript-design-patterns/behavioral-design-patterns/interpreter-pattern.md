### Can you explain the Interpreter design pattern?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern is a design pattern in JavaScript that defines a grammar and an interpreter for that grammar, enabling the interpretation of expressions and commands.<br/>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The interpreter approach is appealing because it allows you to create a custom language. This implementation may sound like an absurd idea, yet we're already making custom languages in JavaScript. Why should we create a new language? Domain-specific languages (DSLs) have had a rebirth since the publication of the GoF book. When developing a language tailored to a specific demand is beneficial. For example, structured Query Language (SQL) is exceptionally good at defining the querying of relational databases. On the other hand, regular expressions have shown to be highly successful at parsing and altering the text.<br/>

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Client** -- Example code: _the run() program._

- creates (or is provided) a syntax tree that represents the grammar
- establishes the starting point context for the interpreter
- makes use of the interpret operations

**Context** -- Example code: _Context_

- It provides the interpreter with state information

**TerminalExpression** -- Example code: _Expression_

- performs an interpret operation in conjunction with grammar terminal symbols
- one instance for each phrase's terminal expression

**NonTerminalExpression** -- In example code: _not used_

- implements an interpret operation in the grammar for non-terminal symbols

<br/>

```js
let Context = function (input) {
  this.input = input;
  this.output = 0;
};

Context.prototype = {
  startsWith: function (str) {
    return this.input.substr(0, str.length) === str;
  },
};

let Expression = function (name, one, four, five, nine, multiplier) {
  this.name = name;
  this.one = one;
  this.four = four;
  this.five = five;
  this.nine = nine;
  this.multiplier = multiplier;
};

Expression.prototype = {
  interpret: function (context) {
    if (context.input.length == 0) {
      return;
    } else if (context.startsWith(this.nine)) {
      context.output += 9 * this.multiplier;
      context.input = context.input.substr(2);
    } else if (context.startsWith(this.four)) {
      context.output += 4 * this.multiplier;
      context.input = context.input.substr(2);
    } else if (context.startsWith(this.five)) {
      context.output += 5 * this.multiplier;
      context.input = context.input.substr(1);
    }
    while (context.startsWith(this.one)) {
      context.output += 1 * this.multiplier;
      context.input = context.input.substr(1);
    }
  },
};

function run() {
  let roman = 'MCMXXVIII';
  let context = new Context(roman);
  let tree = [];

  tree.push(new Expression('thousand', 'M', ' ', ' ', ' ', 1000));
  tree.push(new Expression('hundred', 'C', 'CD', 'D', 'CM', 100));
  tree.push(new Expression('ten', 'X', 'XL', 'L', 'XC', 10));
  tree.push(new Expression('one', 'I', 'IV', 'V', 'IX', 1));

  for (let i = 0, len = tree.length; i < len; i++) {
    tree[i].interpret(context);
  }

  console.log(roman + ' = ' + context.output);
}

run();

/*

OUTPUT:

MCMXXVIII = 1928

*/
```

### In what pattern category does the Interpreter pattern belong?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern in JavaScript belongs to the Behavioral design pattern category, which focuses on communication and behavior between objects.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern in JavaScript belongs to the Behavioral design pattern category. This category is concerned with communication and behavior between objects, and the Interpreter pattern specifically defines a grammar and an interpreter for that grammar. This enables the interpretation of expressions and commands, making it useful for parsing and evaluating user input or domain-specific languages.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Some advantages of using the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript are ease of adding new expressions, flexibility, and ability to implement domain-specific languages.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the Interpreter Pattern.

**Tested and used solution**

- It's a tried-and-true, reusable solution used in several different applications.
- Because the pattern uses classes to describe grammatical rules, updating and extending the grammar is simple.

**Extendable and straightforward to modify**

- Because the pattern describes grammatical rules using classes, updating and extending the grammar is trivial. Using inheritance, you can edit or expand the grammar.
- Existing expressions can be changed progressively: we define new expressions as variants of existing ones.

**Simple to implement**

- Putting the grammar into practice is similarly straightforward. Classes that define nodes in the abstract syntax tree have comparable implementations.
- These classes are simple to write, and they are typically generated automatically by a compiler or parser generator.

### What are some of the disadvantages of employing the Interpreter pattern?

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Some disadvantages of using the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript are potential performance issues and increased complexity due to the need for parsing and evaluating expressions.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Drawbacks of the Interpreter Pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Because grammar with many rules can be challenging to manage and maintain, the Interpreter pattern creates at least one class for each rule in the grammar.
- Other design patterns can be used to mitigate the problem, however when the language is complex, other approaches such as parser or compiler generators are more suited.

### Are there any alternatives to using the Interpreter Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>

  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, there are alternative patterns to the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript, such as the Visitor pattern or the Strategy pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Yes, there are alternative patterns to the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript. The Visitor pattern allows for operations to be performed on an object structure without modifying the objects themselves. The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime. These patterns can offer similar functionality to the Interpreter pattern without some of its potential drawbacks.
