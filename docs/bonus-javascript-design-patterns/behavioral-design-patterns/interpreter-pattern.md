### What is the Interpreter design pattern in JavaScript?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence for a client.

<img src="/img/javascript-interpreter.jpg" /><br /><br />

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Client** -- Example code: _the run() program._

- creates (or is provided) a syntax tree that represents the grammar
- establishes the starting point context for the interpreter
- makes use of the interpret operations

**Context** -- Example code: _Context_

- It provides the interpreter with state information

**TerminalExpression** -- Example code: _Expression_

- performs an interpret operation in conjunction with grammar terminal symbols
- one instance for each phrase's terminal expression

**NonTerminalExpression** -- In example code: _not used_

- implements an interpret operation in the grammar for non-terminal symbols

**Here is an example of how we can implement the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript to interpret Roman numerals.**

In this example, we will have classes to interpret each Roman numeral (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). Then, we use these interpreters to translate a Roman numeral string to an integer.

```javascript
class Interpreter {
    constructor() {
        this.grammar = {
            "M": 1000,
            "D": 500,
            "C": 100,
            "L": 50,
            "X": 10,
            "V": 5,
            "I": 1
        };
    }
    
    interpret(input) {
        let output = 0;
        for(let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
            let current = this.grammar[input[i]];
            let next = this.grammar[input[i + 1]];
            if(next && current < next) {
                output -= current;
            } else {
                output += current;
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
}

// Usage
let interpreter = new Interpreter();

console.log(interpreter.interpret('MCMXCIV')); // Output: 1994
console.log(interpreter.interpret('IX')); // Output: 9
console.log(interpreter.interpret('LVIII')); // Output: 58
```

In this example, the `interpret` function walks through the input string, adding the current symbol value to the total output, or subtracting if the next symbol's value is larger. By doing so, it's able to correctly interpret Roman numeral strings.

### What's the basic structure of the Interpreter pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript's Interpreter pattern, objects include the 'Interpreter' that contains grammar definitions and the 'interpret' function that evaluates expressions based on this grammar.

### In what pattern category does the Interpreter pattern belong?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern in JavaScript belongs to the Behavioral design pattern category, which focuses on communication and behavior between objects.
    </div><br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Interpreter pattern in JavaScript belongs to the Behavioral design pattern category. This category is concerned with communication and behavior between objects, and the Interpreter pattern specifically defines a grammar and an interpreter for that grammar. This enables the interpretation of expressions and commands, making it useful for parsing and evaluating user input or domain-specific languages.

**Tested and used solution**

- It's a tried-and-true, reusable solution used in several different applications.
- Because the pattern uses classes to describe grammatical rules, updating and extending the grammar is simple.

**Extendable and straightforward to modify**

- Because the pattern describes grammatical rules using classes, updating and extending the grammar is trivial. Using inheritance, you can edit or expand the grammar.
- Existing expressions can be changed progressively: we define new expressions as variants of existing ones.

**Simple to implement**

- Putting the grammar into practice is similarly straightforward. Classes that define nodes in the abstract syntax tree have comparable implementations.
- These classes are simple to write, and they are typically generated automatically by a compiler or parser generator.

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Some disadvantages of using the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript are potential performance issues and increased complexity due to the need for parsing and evaluating expressions.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Drawbacks of the Interpreter Pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Because grammar with many rules can be challenging to manage and maintain, the Interpreter pattern creates at least one class for each rule in the grammar.
- Other design patterns can be used to mitigate the problem, however when the language is complex, other approaches such as parser or compiler generators are more suited.

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, there are alternative patterns to the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript, such as the Visitor pattern or the Strategy pattern.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Yes, there are alternative patterns to the Interpreter pattern in JavaScript. The Visitor pattern allows for operations to be performed on an object structure without modifying the objects themselves. The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime. These patterns can offer similar functionality to the Interpreter pattern without some of its potential drawbacks.

### How does the Interpreter pattern relate to the Composite pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Both patterns use tree structures. The Interpreter pattern uses it to represent grammar expressions while the Composite pattern organizes objects into tree structures.

### What are Terminal and NonTerminal expressions in the Interpreter pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In the Interpreter pattern, terminal expressions represent the simplest, indivisible forms of a language. Non-terminal expressions are compositions of one or more terminal or other non-terminal expressions.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here is an example of an arithmetic expression interpreter using modern JavaScript.

```javascript
class TerminalExpression {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    interpret() {
        return this.value;
    }
}

class AddExpression {
    constructor(expr1, expr2) {
        this.expr1 = expr1;
        this.expr2 = expr2;
    }
    
    interpret() {
        return this.expr1.interpret() + this.expr2.interpret();
    }
}

class MultiplyExpression {
    constructor(expr1, expr2) {
        this.expr1 = expr1;
        this.expr2 = expr2;
    }
    
    interpret() {
        return this.expr1.interpret() * this.expr2.interpret();
    }
}

// Terminal expressions
let five = new TerminalExpression(5);
let three = new TerminalExpression(3);

// Non-terminal expressions
let add = new AddExpression(five, three);
let multiply = new MultiplyExpression(add, three);

console.log(multiply.interpret()); // Output: 24
```

In this example, `TerminalExpression` represents terminal expressions, which are the numbers themselves. `AddExpression` and `MultiplyExpression` are non-terminal expressions, they represent arithmetic operations that involve other expressions.

### What role does the 'context' play in the Interpreter pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In the Interpreter pattern, 'context' stores and manages the global information that's shared among all expressions during interpretation, like variables' values.
