### What is the Iterator Design Pattern in JavaScript?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern in JavaScript that provides a way to sequentially access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
    </div><br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Iterator Pattern allows you to progressively access and explores elements of an aggregate object (collection) without exposing its underlying representation. This technique enables JavaScript writers to create significantly more versatile and sophisticated looping constructs. Iterators and Generators got introduced in ES6, which aids in implementing the Iteration pattern.

**The objects participating in this pattern are:**

**Client** -- In example code: _the run() function_

- references and invokes Iterator with a collection of objects

**Iterator** -- In example code: _Iterator_

- implements Iterator interface with methods first(), next(), etc
- keeps track of the current position when traversing the collection

**Items** -- In example code: _Items_

- individual objects of the collection getting traversed

<br/>

In modern JavaScript, we often use the Iterator pattern without even knowing it. For example, when we use `for...of` loops or the `Array.prototype.forEach` method.

The built-in JavaScript data types like `Array`, `String`, `Set`, `Map` are all iterables because they implement the Iterable interface, meaning they expose a method whose key is `Symbol.iterator`.

**Here is a simple example of how you might use the Iterator Design Pattern in Modern JavaScript:**

```javascript
// Define the collection
let collection = {
  items: ["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"],
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let index = -1;
    return {
      next: () => ({
        value: this.items[++index],
        done: index >= this.items.length
      })
    };
  }
};

// Iterate over the collection using the for...of loop
for (let item of collection) {
  console.log(item); // Output: Item1, Item2, Item3
}
```

In this example, the collection object implements the iterable interface by providing a method at the `Symbol.iterator` key. This method returns an iterator object, which defines a `next` method that returns the next value in the sequence.

The `for...of` loop implicitly calls the collection's `[Symbol.iterator]()` method, and then iterates over the returned iterator, logging each value to the console.

**Detailed use without Symbol.Iterator:**

```js
let Iterator = function (items) {
  this.index = 0;
  this.items = items;
};

Iterator.prototype = {
  first: function () {
    this.reset();
    return this.next();
  },
  next: function () {
    return this.items[this.index++];
  },
  hasNext: function () {
    return this.index <= this.items.length;
  },
  reset: function () {
    this.index = 0;
  },
  each: function (callback) {
    for (let item = this.first(); this.hasNext(); item = this.next()) {
      callback(item);
    }
  },
};

function run() {
  let items = ['one', 2, 'circle', true, 'Applepie'];
  let iter = new Iterator(items);

  // using for loop

  for (let item = iter.first(); iter.hasNext(); item = iter.next()) {
    console.log(item);
  }
  console.log('');

  // using Iterator's each method

  iter.each(function (item) {
    console.log(item);
  });
}

run();

/*

OUTPUT:

one
2
circle
true
Applepie

one
2
circle
true
Applepie

*/
```

<strong className="codeExample">Code Example #2:</strong><br /><br />

```js
const items = [1, 'hello', false, 99.8];

function Iterator(items) {
  this.items = items;
  this.index = 0; // to start from beginning position of array
}

Iterator.prototype = {
  // returns true if a next element is available
  hasNext: function () {
    return this.index < this.items.length;
  },
  //returns next element
  next: function () {
    return this.items[this.index++];
  },
};

//Instantiate object for Iterator
const iterator = new Iterator(items);

while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  console.log(iterator.next());
}
/*
OUTPUT
 
1
hello
false
99.8
 
*/
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Iterator Pattern in JavaScript should be utilized when iterating over complex data structures such as trees and graphs, or when implementing lazy evaluation and custom iteration behaviors.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> This pattern helps deal with iteration-related challenges, constructing flexible looping constructs, and retrieving items from a complex collection without knowing the underlying representation. We can use it to create a generic iterator that efficiently explores any collection regardless of its type.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Benefits of the Iterator Pattern
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Singular Responsibility Principle By separating cumbersome traversal algorithms into different classes, you may clean up the client code and collections.
- The Open/Closed Principle -- You can add new types of collections and iterators to existing code without affecting anything.
- Because each iterator object maintains its iteration state, you can concurrently iterate over the same collection.
- For the same reason, you can postpone an iteration and resume it later.

- Using the pattern may be overkill if your software works with simple collections.
- Using an iterator may be less productive than going over elements of specific specialized collections directly.

### What is the relationship between the Iterator Pattern and the Composite Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Composite Pattern often uses the Iterator Pattern to traverse composite structures consistently.
  </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Iterator pattern and the Composite pattern are two design patterns that can work together very well. The Composite pattern allows you to treat both individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way. The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

To illustrate how these patterns can be used together, let's consider a file system. In this system, a `Directory` can contain `Files` and other `Directories`. Here's how you might model this using the Composite and Iterator patterns:

```javascript
class File {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let done = false;
    return {
      next: () => {
        if (!done) {
          done = true;
          return { value: this.name, done: false };
        }
        return { value: undefined, done: true };
      }
    };
  }
}

class Directory {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.children = [];
  }

  add(child) {
    this.children.push(child);
    return this;
  }

  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let index = -1;
    return {
      next: () => {
        if (++index < this.children.length) {
          return { value: this.children[index], done: false };
        }
        return { value: undefined, done: true };
      }
    };
  }
}

let root = new Directory('root');
let bin = new Directory('bin');
let usr = new Directory('usr');
let file1 = new File('file1');
let file2 = new File('file2');

root.add(bin).add(usr).add(file1);
bin.add(file2);

for (let file of root) {
  if (file instanceof File) {
    console.log(file.name); // file1, file2
  } else {
    console.log(`Directory: ${file.name}`); // Directory: bin, Directory: usr
  }
}
```

In this example, both `File` and `Directory` are treated uniformly as `FileSystemNode`. Both `File` and `Directory` define a `[Symbol.iterator]()` method, which means they can both be iterated over using a `for...of` loop. The difference is that a `File` iteration always yields a single item, while a `Directory` iteration can yield multiple items (other directories or files). This combination of the Composite and Iterator patterns allows us to work with complex tree-like structures in a very efficient way.
