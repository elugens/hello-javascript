### What is the Visitor Design Pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows for adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes by separating them into visitor objects.<br/>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you detach algorithms from the objects on which they act. The Visitor pattern adds new methods to a group of objects without affecting them, and the new logic gets housed in a distinct entity known as the Visitor.<br/>
    </div>
    <div>

  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<img src="/img/javascript-visitor.jpg" /><br /><br />

<br/>

Below is an example of the Visitor design pattern in JavaScript:

```javascript
class ObjectStructure {
  constructor() {
    this.nodes = [];
  }

  add(node) {
    this.nodes.push(node);
  }

  accept(visitor) {
    this.nodes.forEach(node => node.accept(visitor));
  }
}

class NodeA {
  accept(visitor) {
    visitor.visitNodeA(this);
  }

  operationA() {
    return 'NodeA is visited';
  }
}

class NodeB {
  accept(visitor) {
    visitor.visitNodeB(this);
  }

  operationB() {
    return 'NodeB is visited';
  }
}

class Visitor {
  visitNodeA(node) {
    console.log(node.operationA());
  }

  visitNodeB(node) {
    console.log(node.operationB());
  }
}

// Usage
const objectStructure = new ObjectStructure();
objectStructure.add(new NodeA());
objectStructure.add(new NodeB());

const visitor = new Visitor();

// This will run the corresponding visitor method for each node in the object structure
objectStructure.accept(visitor);
```

In this example, we have a couple of node classes (`NodeA` and `NodeB`) each with a method `accept` that accepts a visitor object. The visitor has a method for each type of node that it can visit (`visitNodeA` and `visitNodeB`). These methods are then called on each of the nodes in the `ObjectStructure` when the `accept` method is called on the `ObjectStructure`, passing the visitor as a parameter. The result is that the corresponding method on the visitor is called for each type of node in the `ObjectStructure`.

:::note
This is a simple example, and the real value of the Visitor pattern comes when the object structure and/or the algorithms being separated out are more complex, but this should give you a basic idea of how it works.

### Why use the Visitor Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Visitor Pattern is useful when you need to perform operations across a disparate set of objects. It promotes loose coupling and easier addition of operations.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The JavaScript Visitor Pattern should be used when you have a complex object structure and need to add new operations without modifying the object classes, or when you need to separate concerns.<br/><br/><strong>We can use the visitor pattern when:</strong>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Similar procedures must get done on various data structure objects.
- Specific operations must get carried out on multiple items in the data structure.
- You wish to make libraries or frameworks more extensible.

    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the Visitor Pattern
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- The principle of open/closed. You may add new behavior that works with objects of various classes without modifying the classes themselves.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can move multiple versions of the same behavior into the same class.
- While working with various objects, a visitor object might get helpful information. This information is helpful if you wish to traverse a complicated object structure, such as an object tree, and apply the Visitor to each item in the structure.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Drawbacks of the Visitor Pattern.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Every time a class is added or withdrawn from the element hierarchy, you must notify all visitors.
- Visitors may not have access to the private fields and methods of the components they get expected to operate.

### What are the main components of the Visitor Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The main components are the Visitor, Concrete Visitor, Element, Concrete Element, and Object Structure.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">The Visitor Design Pattern in JavaScript comprises several components, mainly:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

1. `Visitor`: This is an interface or abstract class that declares a `visit` method for each type of `Visitable` object.

2. `ConcreteVisitor`: This is a concrete class that implements the `Visitor` interface or extends the abstract `Visitor` class. It implements the `visit` method for each type of `Visitable` object.

3. `Visitable` or `Element`: This is an interface or abstract class that declares the `accept` method, which takes a `Visitor` as an argument.

4. `ConcreteElement`: This is a concrete class that implements the `Visitable` or `Element` interface or extends the abstract `Element` class. It implements the `accept` method.

5. `ObjectStructure`: This is a collection of `ConcreteElements`. It can enumerate its elements and may provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its elements.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Visitable or Element
class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  accept(visitor) {
    visitor.visit(this);
  }
}

// ConcreteElement
class Developer extends Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    super(name, salary);
  }
}

// ConcreteElement
class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    super(name, salary);
  }
}

// Visitor
class Payroll {
  visit(employee) {
    let monthlySalary;

    if (employee instanceof Manager) {
      monthlySalary = employee.salary / 12;
      console.log(`${employee.name}'s monthly salary is ${monthlySalary.toFixed(2)}`);
    }

    if (employee instanceof Developer) {
      monthlySalary = employee.salary / 12;
      console.log(`${employee.name}'s monthly salary is ${monthlySalary.toFixed(2)}`);
    }
  }
}

// ObjectStructure
class Employees {
  constructor() {
    this.employees = [];
  }

  addEmployee(employee) {
    this.employees.push(employee);
  }

  accept(visitor) {
    this.employees.forEach(employee => employee.accept(visitor));
  }
}

// Usage
let employees = new Employees();
employees.addEmployee(new Manager('John Doe', 120000));
employees.addEmployee(new Developer('Jane Doe', 80000));

let payroll = new Payroll();
employees.accept(payroll);
```

In this example, `Employee` is the `Visitable` or `Element` class, `Developer` and `Manager` are the `ConcreteElement` classes, `Payroll` is the `Visitor` or `ConcreteVisitor`, and `Employees` is the `ObjectStructure`. The `accept` method in the `Employee` class lets a `Visitor` object visit it, in this case, to calculate monthly salaries. The `Payroll` class implements the `visit` method to calculate and print the monthly salary for each type of `Employee`. The `Employees` class represents an object structure that can enumerate its elements and allow a visitor to visit them.
