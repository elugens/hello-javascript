### What is the State Design Pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> TThe State Design Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, seemingly changing its class. It promotes loose coupling and increases manageability.<br/>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The State pattern provides state-specific logic to a limited set of objects in which each object represents a particular state. The State pattern is commonly used in JavaScript to convert massive switch-base state machines into objects.<br/>
    </div>
    <div>
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<img src="/img/javascript-state.jpg" /><br /><br />

**This pattern's objects are as follows:**

**Context** -- example code: _TrafficLight_

- exposes an interface that supports clients of the service
- keeps a reference to a state object that defines the current state.
- Allows State objects to change their current state to another state.

**State** -- example code: _Red, Yellow, Green_

- captures the state's values and associated behavior

<br/>

```js
let TrafficLight = function () {
  let count = 0;
  let currentState = new Red(this);

  this.change = function (state) {
    // limits number of changes
    if (count++ >= 10) return;
    currentState = state;
    currentState.go();
  };

  this.start = function () {
    currentState.go();
  };
};

let Red = function (light) {
  this.light = light;

  this.go = function () {
    console.log('Red --> for 1 minute');
    light.change(new Green(light));
  };
};

let Yellow = function (light) {
  this.light = light;

  this.go = function () {
    console.log('Yellow --> for 10 seconds');
    light.change(new Red(light));
  };
};

let Green = function (light) {
  this.light = light;

  this.go = function () {
    console.log('Green --> for 1 minute');
    light.change(new Yellow(light));
  };
};

function run() {
  let light = new TrafficLight();
  light.start();
}

run();

/*

OUTPUT:

Red --> for 1 minute
Green --> for 1 minute
Yellow --> for 10 seconds
Red --> for 1 minute
Green --> for 1 minute
Yellow --> for 10 seconds
Red --> for 1 minute
Green --> for 1 minute
Yellow --> for 10 seconds
Red --> for 1 minute
Green --> for 1 minute

*/
```

### The State pattern belongs to which pattern category?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The State pattern belongs to the behavioral pattern category in JavaScript. It focuses on the behavior of objects and how they respond to changes in their internal state.
    </div>
  </div>

### When should you utilize the JavaScript State Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> You should utilize the JavaScript State Pattern when you have an object with multiple behaviors that depend on its internal state, leading to complex conditional statements.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> In a real-world application, the State pattern could be handy for introducing new states that we haven't yet considered, possibly more simply than a switch case. Each state is contained and has its own set of internal functions.

### What are some of the advantages of employing the State pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Advantages of employing the State pattern in JavaScript include improved code organization, flexibility, maintainability, and reduced conditional statements. It also enables easier testing.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the State Pattern
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Singular Responsibility Principle -- Separate the code related to each state into separate classes.
- The Open/Closed Principle - Add new states without modifying existing state classes or the context.
- Simplify the contextual code by removing bulky state machine conditionals.

### What are some drawbacks of using the State Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> It might increase complexity due to the creation of multiple new classes and also involve additional memory costs. Applying the pattern may be excessive if a state machine has only a few states or infrequently changes.
    </div>

### Are there any alternatives to using the State pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, alternatives to using the State pattern in JavaScript include using conditional statements, using the Strategy pattern, or using polymorphism to represent different states.
    </div>

### Why use the State Design Pattern in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It's used to manage complexity in code by allowing objects to change their behavior according to their current state, improving readability and maintainability.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What kind of problems does the State Design Pattern solve?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It solves problems where an object's behavior needs to change based on its state, avoiding long conditionals and making state transitions explicit.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does the State Design Pattern differ from the Strategy Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> While both involve encapsulated behaviors, State Pattern changes behavior based on internal state, while Strategy Pattern does so based on external control.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can you explain the concept of 'Context' and 'State' in the State Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'Context' is the entity having varying behavior, while 'State' encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state of 'Context'.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What's the benefit of encapsulating state-specific behavior in a State Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> It makes the code more organized, easier to understand, and the states are easier to manage or extend in the future.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### When is the State Design Pattern not suitable?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When there are only a few states or transitions, or the complexity of different states doesn't justify the overhead of the pattern.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### Can State Design Pattern lead to performance issues?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Generally not, but if there are numerous complex states, it might potentially lead to performance considerations.
