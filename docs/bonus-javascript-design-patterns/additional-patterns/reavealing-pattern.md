  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Revealing Pattern is a JavaScript design pattern that provides a way to expose specific functions and variables publicly while keeping others private, promoting modularity and encapsulation.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The revealing module pattern is a design pattern that helps in organizing and structuring JavaScript code. It involves creating a function that returns an object that exposes only the properties and methods that are necessary, while keeping other properties and methods private.<br/>

  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

```js
// ES2015+ keywords/syntax used: let, const, method declaration, arrow function
//              template literals for string interpolation, import, export

let privateVar = 'Ben Cherry';
const publicVar = 'Hey there!';

const privateFunction = () => {
  console.log(`Name:${privateVar}`);
};

const publicSetName = (strName) => {
  privateVar = strName;
};

const publicGetName = () => {
  privateFunction();
};

// Reveal public pointers to
// private functions and properties
const myRevealingModule = {
  setName: publicSetName,
  greeting: publicVar,
  getName: publicGetName,
};

export default myRevealingModule;

// Usage:
import myRevealingModule from './myRevealingModule';

myRevealingModule.setName('Paul Kinlan');
