        text: 'The proxy pattern attempts to lighten the load on the target object. It is useful when dealing with large applications that make many network requests. Because delays may occur when responding to such requests, using a proxy pattern prevents the target object from becoming overburdened with requests. HTTP requests are a real-world example. Because these are costly operations, the proxy pattern aids in reducing the number of requests forwarded to the target.',

You can control the lifecycle of the service object even if your clients do not care. The proxy functions even if the service object is not ready or unavailable. Open/Closed Principle. Users can add new proxies without interrupting the service or clients.',
