### What is the composite design pattern in Modern JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>

  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The composite pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
    </div><br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Composite Pattern, structurally, allows you to compose objects into a tree-like structure, allowing us to work with them as individual objects. Partitioning is another term for this. The Composite pattern enables the creation of objects with primitive items or a collection of object properties. Each item in the group can hold other collections, allowing for deeply nested structures.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
class Component {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  getNodeName() {
    return this._name;
  }

  // This method should be overridden by the Composite class
  add() {}

  // This method should be overridden by the Composite class
  remove() {}

  // This method should be overridden by the Leaf class
  display() {}
}

class Leaf extends Component {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  // Override the display method of the Component class
  display(depth = 0) {
    console.log(`${"-".repeat(depth)}${this._name}`);
  }
}

class Composite extends Component {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this._children = [];
  }

  // Override the add method of the Component class
  add(component) {
    this._children.push(component);
  }

  // Override the remove method of the Component class
  remove(component) {
    const componentIndex = this._children.indexOf(component);
    if (componentIndex !== -1) {
      this._children.splice(componentIndex, 1);
    }
  }

  // Override the display method of the Component class
  display(depth = 0) {
    console.log(`${"-".repeat(depth)}${this._name}`);
    for (let i = 0; i < this._children.length; i++) {
      this._children[i].display(depth + 2);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const tree = new Composite("root");
const branch1 = new Composite("branch1");
const branch2 = new Composite("branch2");
const leaf1 = new Leaf("leaf1");
const leaf2 = new Leaf("leaf2");
const leaf3 = new Leaf("leaf3");

branch1.add(leaf1);
branch1.add(leaf2);
branch2.add(leaf3);
tree.add(branch1);
tree.add(branch2);
tree.display();
```

In this example, we're creating a tree-like structure. Each 'branch' can contain other branches or leaves, but leaves can't contain other components. When the display method is called on the root node, it recursively displays all of its children.

### Can you specify a use case for the Composite Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Composite pattern is powerful as it allows us to treat an object as a composite. Since both single and composite objects share the same interface, it enables reusing objects without worrying about their compatibility.
    </div><br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Composite Pattern describes a collection of objects treated in the same way that a single instance of an object can. This approach allows us to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly, which means the same behavior is applied when working with one or a thousand items. We use this pattern to create a scalable application with many objects, and it is useful when dealing with an object hierarchy that resembles a tree. Your operating system, for example, uses this pattern to create directories and sub-directories. Some libraries also use composite patterns such as React and Vue to create reusable interfaces.

  <div></div>

Let's consider a scenario where we want to represent a nested menu structure using composite pattern. Each menu could contain other submenus or menu items (which cannot contain anything).

Here is an example in modern JavaScript:

```javascript
class MenuComponent {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  getName() {
    return this._name;
  }

  add() {}

  remove() {}

  display() {}
}

class MenuItem extends MenuComponent {
  constructor(name, url) {
    super(name);
    this._url = url;
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`${this._name}: ${this._url}`);
  }
}

class SubMenu extends MenuComponent {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this._menuComponents = [];
  }

  add(menuComponent) {
    this._menuComponents.push(menuComponent);
  }

  remove(menuComponent) {
    const menuComponentIndex = this._menuComponents.indexOf(menuComponent);
    if (menuComponentIndex !== -1) {
      this._menuComponents.splice(menuComponentIndex, 1);
    }
  }

  display() {
    console.log(`${this._name}`);
    for (let i = 0; i < this._menuComponents.length; i++) {
      this._menuComponents[i].display();
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const mainMenu = new SubMenu("Main Menu");

const fileMenu = new SubMenu("File");
const newFile = new MenuItem("New", "/file/new");
const openFile = new MenuItem("Open", "/file/open");
fileMenu.add(newFile);
fileMenu.add(openFile);

const editMenu = new SubMenu("Edit");
const cut = new MenuItem("Cut", "/edit/cut");
const copy = new MenuItem("Copy", "/edit/copy");
editMenu.add(cut);
editMenu.add(copy);

mainMenu.add(fileMenu);
mainMenu.add(editMenu);

mainMenu.display();
```

In this example, we're creating a menu-like structure. Each 'SubMenu' can contain other 'SubMenu' objects or 'MenuItem' objects, but 'MenuItem' objects can't contain other components. When the display method is called on the main menu, it recursively displays all of its children.

### What objects participate in the Composite Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>  
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> In the Composite Pattern in JavaScript, there are two types of objects: the composite object that represents a tree structure, and the leaf object that represents a single element in the tree.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The participating objects in the Composite Pattern include the Component, Leaf, and Composite objects.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

In the Composite Pattern, there are typically three roles that objects can take on:

1. **Component**: This is a base class that defines the common interface for both simple (Leaf) and complex (Composite) objects in the composition.

2. **Leaf**: These are the basic elements of the composition and do not have their own sub-elements.

3. **Composite**: These are elements that can have sub-elements. Composites contain leaf elements and other composites.

Here's a code example in modern JavaScript demonstrating these roles:

```javascript
// Component
class Graphic {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  getName() {
    return this._name;
  }

  draw() {}

  add() {}

  remove() {}
}

// Leaf
class Circle extends Graphic {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  draw() {
    console.log(`Draw ${this._name}`);
  }
}

// Composite
class CompoundGraphic extends Graphic {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this._children = [];
  }

  add(graphic) {
    this._children.push(graphic);
  }

  remove(graphic) {
    const graphicIndex = this._children.indexOf(graphic);
    if (graphicIndex !== -1) {
      this._children.splice(graphicIndex, 1);
    }
  }

  draw() {
    console.log(`Draw ${this._name}`);
    for (let i = 0; i < this._children.length; i++) {
      this._children[i].draw();
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const circle1 = new Circle("circle1");
const circle2 = new Circle("circle2");
const graphic = new CompoundGraphic("graphic");

graphic.add(circle1);
graphic.add(circle2);
graphic.draw();
```

In this example, `Graphic` is the Component, `Circle` is the Leaf, and `CompoundGraphic` is the Composite. You can see how `CompoundGraphic` can contain both Leaf (i.e., `Circle`) and Composite (i.e., other `CompoundGraphic`) objects, and work with them uniformly via the `draw` method.

### What is the purpose of the 'Component' in the Composite Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'Component' declares the interface for objects in the composition and for accessing and managing its child components.

### How does the 'Leaf' in Composite Design Pattern function?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'Leaf' represents leaf objects in the composition and doesn't have any children. It defines behavior for primitive objects.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the role of 'Composite' in the Composite Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'Composite' stores child components and implements child-related operations in the Component interface.
  </div>
  </div>
</details>

---

### How does Composite Design Pattern handle adding or removing components?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Composite Pattern uses add() and remove() methods in the Composite class to manage child Component objects, allowing uniform handling of both individual (Leaf) and composite objects.
