### What is the Bridge Design Pattern in Modern JavaScript?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. It enables the separation of a class's interface from its implementation, often for the purposes of providing multiple implementations.

  <div></div>

Here's an example using modern JavaScript (ES6).

```javascript
// The abstraction
class SmartDevice {
  constructor(operatingSystem) {
    this.operatingSystem = operatingSystem;
  }

  turnOn() {
    this.operatingSystem.start();
  }

  turnOff() {
    this.operatingSystem.shutDown();
  }
}

// The implementation
class OperatingSystem {
  start() {
    throw new Error("This method must be overwritten!");
  }

  shutDown() {
    throw new Error("This method must be overwritten!");
  }
}

class Android extends OperatingSystem {
  start() {
    console.log("Starting the Android system...");
  }

  shutDown() {
    console.log("Shutting down the Android system...");
  }
}

class iOS extends OperatingSystem {
  start() {
    console.log("Starting the iOS system...");
  }

  shutDown() {
    console.log("Shutting down the iOS system...");
  }
}

// Using the Bridge Design Pattern
const myAndroidDevice = new SmartDevice(new Android());
myAndroidDevice.turnOn(); // Output: Starting the Android system...

const myIOSDevice = new SmartDevice(new iOS());
myIOSDevice.turnOn(); // Output: Starting the iOS system...
```

In this example, `SmartDevice` is our abstraction that we want to decouple from its implementation (the `OperatingSystem`), allowing each to vary independently. The `SmartDevice` class isn't concerned with how the `OperatingSystem` is implemented, and similarly, the `OperatingSystem` doesn't care how it's used by `SmartDevice`. This makes it easy to add new types of devices and operating systems without modifying existing code.

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Bridge pattern in JavaScript is often used in situations where you need to separate an abstraction from its implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and extensibility in development.

### What are the objects that participate in the Bridge Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The participating objects in the Bridge pattern are the Abstraction, RefinedAbstraction, Implementor, and ConcreteImplementor, which decouple the interface from the implementation allowing both to vary independently.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Objects that participate in the Bridge pattern include:

**1. Abstraction:** defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type `Implementor`.

**2. RefinedAbstraction:** extends the interface defined by `Abstraction`.

**3. Implementor**: defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface doesn't have to correspond exactly to `Abstraction`'s interface; in fact, the two interfaces can be quite different.

**4. ConcreteImplementor:** implements the `Implementor` interface and defines its concrete implementation.

Here's a code example in modern JavaScript (ES6) which showcases these components.

```javascript
// Implementor
class DrawingAPI {
  drawCircle(x, y, radius) {
    throw new Error('This method must be overridden!');
  }
}

// ConcreteImplementor 1
class DrawingAPI1 extends DrawingAPI {
  drawCircle(x, y, radius) {
    console.log(`API1.circle at ${x}:${y} radius ${radius}`);
  }
}

// ConcreteImplementor 2
class DrawingAPI2 extends DrawingAPI {
  drawCircle(x, y, radius) {
    console.log(`API2.circle at ${x}:${y} radius ${radius}`);
  }
}

// Abstraction
class Shape {
  constructor(drawingAPI) {
    if (this.constructor === Shape) {
      throw new Error('Cannot instantiate abstract class!');
    }

    this.drawingAPI = drawingAPI;
  }

  draw() {
    throw new Error('This method must be overridden!');
  }

  resizeByPercentage(pct) {
    throw new Error('This method must be overridden!');
  }
}

// RefinedAbstraction
class CircleShape extends Shape {
  constructor(x, y, radius, drawingAPI) {
    super(drawingAPI);
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  draw() {
    this.drawingAPI.drawCircle(this.x, this.y, this.radius);
  }

  resizeByPercentage(pct) {
    this.radius *= pct;
  }
}

// Usage:
const shapes = [
  new CircleShape(1, 2, 3, new DrawingAPI1()),
  new CircleShape(5, 7, 11, new DrawingAPI2())
];

for (let shape of shapes) {
  shape.resizeByPercentage(2.5);
  shape.draw();
}
```

### What are some of the advantages of employing the Bridge pattern?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Some advantages of using the Bridge pattern in JavaScript include increased flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse, as well as improved maintainability and reduced complexity.

    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Benefits of the Bridge Pattern
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Loosely coupled code - Because the bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, changes to the implementation do not affect the client code. The client code does not need to be compiled when the implementation changes.
- Reduces code duplication while increasing code maintainability and reusability.
- Classes and applications that are platform agnostic can be created.
- Helps to promote the Open-Closed principle, new abstractions and implementations can be developed independently.
- Decoupling abstraction from implementation: bridge pattern can avoid the binding between abstraction and implementation and select the implementation at run time.
- Improved Extensibility â€“ Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Drawbacks of the Bridge Pattern
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- Bridge pattern implementation increases code complexity.
- Interfaces with only a single implementation.
- Using the technique in a highly cohesive class may cause the code to become more complicated.
