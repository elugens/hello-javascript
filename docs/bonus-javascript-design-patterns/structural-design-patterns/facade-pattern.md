### What is the facade design pattern in JavaScript?

<details className='answer'>
  <summary>

  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Facade design pattern is a software design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system. A facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying code.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Façade design pattern creates an interface that protects clients from complex functionality in one or more sub-systems. It's a simple pattern that may appear insignificant, but it's powerful and advantageous. We commonly find it in systems based on a multi-layer architecture.
    </div><br/>
    <div>
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
class ComplexSystem {
    operationA() {
        return 'Doing complex operation A\n';
    }

    operationB() {
        return 'Doing complex operation B\n';
    }

    operationC() {
        return 'Doing complex operation C\n';
    }
}

class Facade {
    constructor(system) {
        this.system = system;
    }

    simpleOperation() {
        let result = '';
        result += this.system.operationA();
        result += this.system.operationB();
        result += this.system.operationC();
        return result;
    }
}

// Using the facade
let system = new ComplexSystem();
let facade = new Facade(system);

console.log(facade.simpleOperation()); // Runs all operations at once and masks the complexity.
```

In this example, `ComplexSystem` has multiple methods (`operationA`, `operationB`, and `operationC`) that can be called individually, but it may be more convenient to perform these operations all at once. The `Facade` class provides a method `simpleOperation` that does exactly that.

When a client interacts with the `Facade` instance (by calling `simpleOperation`), the facade forwards those requests to appropriate methods of the `ComplexSystem`. The client doesn't need to be aware of the `ComplexSystem` class, which encapsulates complex functionality. This simplifies the client's interaction with the system.

### Why use the Facade Design Pattern?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> In JavaScript, you should employ the Facade pattern when you need to provide a simpler and more unified interface to a complex system or set of objects, reducing complexity and improving usability.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The facade pattern makes it easier for a client to interact with a system. As a result, it gets used when an application's underlying code is large and complex, and the client does not need to see it.<br/><br/>It gets used in communicating with methods in a library without understanding what is happening behind the scenes. JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, are an example.

### What are the Façade Pattern's object participants?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> In the Facade pattern in JavaScript, the object participants include a Facade class, which provides a simplified interface, and a set of complex subsystem classes or objects that it hides from clients.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> There are two types of objects represented in the Façade Pattern. They consist of the Façade and the Sub Systems (There can be multiple sub-system objects in this pattern). The facade provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem, while the subsystem classes implement more complex functionality. The client interacts with the facade, not the subsystem.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div></div>

- **Facade** – The Façade understands which sub-systems are in charge of a request and routes client requests to the appropriate sub-system objects.
- **Sub Systems** – A sub-system implements and executes specialized sub-system activities, but it has no cohesive knowledge or connection to the Façade itself.

<br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
// Subsystem classes
class SubSystemOne {
    methodOne() {
        console.log('SubSystemOne Method');
    }
}

class SubSystemTwo {
    methodTwo() {
        console.log('SubSystemTwo Method');
    }
}

class SubSystemThree {
    methodThree() {
        console.log('SubSystemThree Method');
    }
}

// Facade
class Facade {
    constructor() {
        this.one = new SubSystemOne();
        this.two = new SubSystemTwo();
        this.three = new SubSystemThree();
    }

    wrapOperation() {
        console.log('Wrap Operation Starts');
        this.one.methodOne();
        this.two.methodTwo();
        this.three.methodThree();
        console.log('Wrap Operation Ends\n');
    }
}

// Client code
const facade = new Facade();
facade.wrapOperation();

// This will output:
// Wrap Operation Starts
// SubSystemOne Method
// SubSystemTwo Method
// SubSystemThree Method
// Wrap Operation Ends
```

In this example, `Facade` is the facade, `SubSystemOne`, `SubSystemTwo`, and `SubSystemThree` are the subsystem classes. `wrapOperation` in `Facade` provides a simplified interface for the operations in the subsystems, and is the method that the client will call.

The subsystem classes may be complex and difficult to use directly, so the facade provides a simple interface to the complex subsystems. The subsystem classes handle tasks required by the facade, but the facade encapsulates this complexity and exposes a simplified interface to the clients. The clients only interact with the facade, not the subsystems.

### Can multiple facades exist for a subsystem?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, it is possible to have multiple facades for a single subsystem. Each facade might provide a different simplified interface to the subsystem, depending on the context or requirements of the client code.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
// Subsystem classes
class SubSystem {
    methodA() {
        console.log('SubSystem Method A');
    }

    methodB() {
        console.log('SubSystem Method B');
    }

    methodC() {
        console.log('SubSystem Method C');
    }
}

// First Facade
class Facade1 {
    constructor(system) {
        this.system = system;
    }

    operationX() {
        console.log('Operation X Starts');
        this.system.methodA();
        this.system.methodB();
        console.log('Operation X Ends\n');
    }
}

// Second Facade
class Facade2 {
    constructor(system) {
        this.system = system;
    }

    operationY() {
        console.log('Operation Y Starts');
        this.system.methodB();
        this.system.methodC();
        console.log('Operation Y Ends\n');
    }
}

// Client code
let system = new SubSystem();

let facade1 = new Facade1(system);
facade1.operationX();

let facade2 = new Facade2(system);
facade2.operationY();

// This will output:
// Operation X Starts
// SubSystem Method A
// SubSystem Method B
// Operation X Ends

// Operation Y Starts
// SubSystem Method B
// SubSystem Method C
// Operation Y Ends
```

In this example, the `SubSystem` has three methods, and two different facades (`Facade1` and `Facade2`) provide different simplified interfaces to these methods. `Facade1` provides `operationX`, which uses `methodA` and `methodB` of the `SubSystem`, and `Facade2` provides `operationY`, which uses `methodB` and `methodC`.

The client code decides which facade to use based on the operations it wants to perform. The use of multiple facades allows different clients or different parts of the code to interact with the subsystem in different ways, while still abstracting the complexity of the subsystem.
