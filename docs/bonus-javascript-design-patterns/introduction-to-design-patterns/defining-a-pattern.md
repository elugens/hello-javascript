      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A pattern that has not yet been known to pass the "pattern"-ity tests is usually referred to as a proto-pattern. Proto-patterns may result from the work of someone that has established a particular solution that is worthy of sharing with the community, but may not have yet had the opportunity to have been vetted heavily due to its very young age.

- **Solves a particular problem:** Patterns are not supposed to just capture principles or strategies. They need to capture solutions. This is one of the most essential ingredients for a good pattern.

- **The solution to this problem cannot be obvious:** We can find that problem-solving techniques often attempt to derive from well-known first principles. The best design patterns usually provide solutions to problems indirectly - this is considered a necessary approach for the most challenging problems related to design.

- **The concept described must have been proven:** Design patterns require proof that they function as described and without this proof the design cannot be seriously considered. If a pattern is highly speculative in nature, only the brave may attempt to use it.

- **It must describe a relationship:** In some cases it may appear that a pattern describes a type of module. Although an implementation may appear this way, the official description of the pattern must describe much deeper system structures and mechanisms that explain its relationship to code.

### What is “The Rule of Three” in relation to design patterns?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> One of the additional requirements for a pattern to be valid is that they display some recurring phenomenon. This is often something that can be qualified in at least three key areas, referred to as the rule of three.<br/><br/>To show recurrence using this rule, one must demonstrate:
    </div>
    <div></div>

1. **Fitness of purpose** - how is the pattern considered successful?

1. **Usefulness** - why is the pattern considered successful?

1. **Applicability** - is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has wider applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is important to keep the above in mind.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The process used to create a new design pattern include documentation of your intent, motivation, structural representation, and code examples. Intent covers the problems and solutions and describes what the pattern does. Motivation explains the problem in detail and how the pattern will solve the problem. Structure covers a diagram of classes and objects that maps each part of the pattern and how they are related. A code example must be provided in order to give clear representation of the pattern.
