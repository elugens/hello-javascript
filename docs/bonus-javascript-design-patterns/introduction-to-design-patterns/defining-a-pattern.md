### What is a proto-pattern in terms of design patterns?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A pattern that has not yet passed "pattern"-ity tests is called a proto-pattern. Proto-patterns result from the work of someone that created a specific solution that is worthy of sharing but may not have yet had the opportunity to be qualified due to its newness.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> A proto-pattern in JavaScript design patterns refers to a pattern that is still in the process of being defined and refined. It may not have a well-established implementation or a widely accepted name.<br/><br/>One example of a proto-pattern is the "null object" pattern, which suggests using a null object to handle situations where a null value is expected.

### What do you name a description or fragment of a proto-pattern?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A brief description or snippet of a pattern is known as patlet or pattern-let.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> A description or fragment of a proto-pattern is sometimes referred to as a "patternlet". A patternlet is a smaller, less well-defined version of a design pattern that is still in the process of being defined and refined.<br/>One example of a patternlet is the "parameter object" patternlet, which involves passing a single object as a parameter instead of multiple individual parameters.

### How can we know if a design pattern is worth utilizing?

<details>

  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A design pattern is worth utilizing if it solves a recurring design problem effectively and efficiently, maintains code simplicity and readability, and is widely accepted and used in the industry.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Estimating a good design pattern.

- **Solves a particular problem:** Patterns are not designed to capture concepts or methods; instead, they are designed to capture solutions. This method is a necessary component of a successful design pattern.

- **There is no clear answer to this problem:** Problem-solving frequently seeks to deduce from well-known concepts. The best design patterns frequently give indirect answers to challenges â€“ this approach is an essential strategy for the most challenging design problems.

- **The concepts must be proven solutions to a problem:** Design patterns require proof that they function as described, and without this, we should not entertain their use.

- **It must describe or express a relationship:** A pattern may represent a module type in some circumstances. While an implementation may appear this way, the formal design description must specify far deeper system structures and processes that explain how it connects to our code.

### What is "The Rule of Three" concerning design patterns?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>View Answer:</strong>
  </summary>
  <div>
  <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Rule of Three in design patterns suggests that a pattern should not be used until the problem it solves has occurred at least three times, to avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.<br/><br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> One of the additional requirements for a pattern to be valid is that they display some recurring phenomenon. We often qualify this approach in three key areas, known as the rule of three.<br/><br/>To show recurrence, one must demonstrate:
    </div>
    <div></div>

1. **Fitness of purpose:** How is the pattern proven to be successful?

1. **Usefulness:** Why is the pattern considered good?

1. **Applicability:** Is the design worthy of being a pattern because it pliable? How we implement, the design pattern must be detailed. When reviewing or defining a design pattern, it is essential to keep the above in mind.

### Describe the process used to author a new design pattern?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The process used to create a new design pattern includes documentation of your intent, motivation, structural representation, and code examples.<br/><br/>
    </div>
    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> The process used to create a new design pattern includes documentation of your intent, motivation, structural representation, and code examples. Intent covers the problems and solutions and describes what the design does. The motivation explains the problem in detail and how the pattern solves the problem. The structure includes a class and object diagram that depicts each aspect of the pattern and how they are connected. The author provides a code example to represent the design.
