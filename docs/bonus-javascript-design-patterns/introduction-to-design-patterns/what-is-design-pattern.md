      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> A design pattern is a reusable piece of code that acts as a solution to recurring problems in JavaScript.

    <div>
      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> A design pattern can be thought of as a template for solving a particular design problem. It is not a finished piece of code that can be directly applied to your program. It is rather a description or template that can give you ideas on how to approach a problem and inspire solutions. Thus, the code for the two different programming scenarios implementing the same pattern can differ.

### Can you name one reason we use design patterns in JavaScript?

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Design patterns provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions to problems within our applications. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> One of the most important aspects of writing maintainable code is being able to notice the recurring themes in that code and optimize them.

### Why is maintainable code is much more difficult to write than maintainable design patterns?

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> The reason for this is that the code you write is not only used by other developers, but also by yourself in the future. If you are not able to notice the patterns in your code, you will be unable to optimize them.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> GoF stands for “Gang of Four” which represents the four engineers including Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides who published  “Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Design patterns provide use with a solid approach to solving problems, act as an out of the box solution, and can be expressive.

      <strong>Technical Response:</strong> Design patterns have three main benefits:

    <div></div>

1. Patterns are proven solutions: They provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven techniques that reflect the experience and insights the developers that helped define them bring to the pattern.
2. Patterns can be easily reused: A pattern usually reflects an out of the box solution that can be adapted to suit our own needs. This feature makes them quite robust.
3. Patterns can be expressive: When we look at a pattern there’s generally a set structure and vocabulary to the solution presented that can help express rather large solutions quite elegantly.

### Are design patterns an exact solution?

<details>

    <div>
      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> No, design patterns are not an exact solution. It’s important that we remember the role of a pattern is merely to provide us with a solution scheme. Patterns don’t solve all design problems nor do they replace good software designers, however, they do support them.

      <strong>Interview Response:</strong> Advantages of using design patterns:

    <div></div>

- **Reusing patterns assists in preventing minor issues that can cause major problems in the application development process.** What this means is when code is built on proven patterns, we can afford to spend less time worrying about the structure of our code and more time focusing on the quality of our overall solution. This is because patterns can encourage us to code in a more structured and organized fashion avoiding the need to refactor it for cleanliness purposes in the future.

- **Patterns can provide generalized solutions which are documented in a fashion that doesn't require them to be tied to a specific problem.** This generalized approach means that regardless of the application (and in many cases the programming language) we are working with, design patterns can be applied to improve the structure of our code.

- **Certain patterns can actually decrease the overall file-size footprint of our code by avoiding repetition.** By encouraging developers to look more closely at their solutions for areas where instant reductions in repetition can be made, e.g. reducing the number of functions performing similar processes in favor of a single generalized function, the overall size of our codebase can be decreased. This is also known as making code more DRY.

- **Patterns add to a developer's vocabulary, which makes communication faster.**

- **Patterns that are frequently used can be improved over time by harnessing the collective experiences other developers using those patterns contribute back to the design pattern community.** In some cases this leads to the creation of entirely new design patterns whilst in others it can lead to the provision of improved guidelines on how specific patterns can be best used. This can ensure that pattern-based solutions continue to become more robust than ad-hoc solutions may be.
