### JavaScript can operate on what kinds of technological platforms?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript operates on various platforms, including web browsers, server-side with Node.js, desktop and mobile applications using frameworks like Electron and React Native, and even IoT devices through specialized libraries.
</div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The JavaScript language can run on a browser, or a webserver or another host, even a “smart” coffee machine, if it can run JavaScript. Each of them provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a host environment. A host environment provides its own objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node.js provides server-side features, and so on.

### Can you briefly explain the general structure of the browser window environment?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A browser at its root consists of a window (root object), DOM, BOM, and the JavaScript Object. The DOM is the document object model, and the BOM is the browser object model. JavaScript is the language used to interact with the window, DOM, and BOM.
</div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The DOM is a tree-like structure representing an HTML document, allowing scripts to manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a webpage. The Document Object Model, or DOM, represents all page content as editable objects.  The principal "entry point" to the page is the document object, and we may use it to edit or create anything on the website.
</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// change the background color to red
document.body.style.background = 'red';

// change it back after 1 second
setTimeout(() => (document.body.style.background = ''), 1000);
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you name a good reference document to find information about the document object model?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Two good reference documents used to reference information about the DOM include the MDN Web Docs and the DOM Living Standard. The DOM Living Standard provides you with detailed information about the specification, and the MDN is a detailed guide expressed in an easy way to learn.
</div>
  </div>

### What is the DOM Living Standard?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The DOM Living Standard is a constantly evolving specification that defines the structure, behavior, and APIs of the Document Object Model, ensuring cross-browser consistency and addressing modern web development requirements.
</div>
  </div>
</details>

### Is the DOM only used in Browsers, or can it be found on other platforms?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> While the DOM is primarily used in browsers, it can also be found on other platforms, such as server-side environments like Node.js, using libraries like JSDOM to simulate browser-like DOM interactions.
</div>
  </div>

### What is the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) used for in a browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is a browser API that represents stylesheets, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate CSS rules and styles applied to HTML elements.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs that allow JavaScript to manipulate CSS. It is similar to the DOM, but for CSS rather than HTML. It enables users to view and alter CSS styles in real-time. It is independent of the DOM, yet they collaborate when we change the document's style rules. CSSOM, on the other hand, is rarely a necessity in reality.

### What is the Browser Object Model in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript represents browser components, such as 'window', 'navigator', and 'location', enabling developers to interact with the browser environment and its properties.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.<br /><br />
  <strong>For Example:</strong><br /><br />
  <ol>
    <li>The navigator object gives context about the browser and the operating system. There are various characteristics, but the navigator and location are the most well-known. userAgent tells us about the current browser, and navigator.platform tells us about the platform (which varies depending on whether it's Windows, Linux, or Mac).</li>
    <li>We can read the current URL and redirect the browser to a new URL using the location object.</li>
  </ol>
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong> Here’s how we can use the location object<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```js
// Here’s how we can use the location object:
alert(location.href); // shows current URL

if (confirm('Go to Wikipedia?')) {
  location.href = 'https://wikipedia.org'; // redirect the browser to another URL
}
```

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Are the alert, confirm, and prompt functions part of the DOM or BOM?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The alert, confirm, and prompt functions are part of the Browser Object Model (BOM), specifically the 'window' object, and are used for displaying simple dialogs to interact with users.
</div>
  </div>
</details>

### Under what specification does the BOM fall?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The BOM falls under the HTML Living Standard specification, which defines the browser environment, including the 'window', 'navigator', and other related objects, in addition to the DOM and HTML elements.</div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The BOM is part of the HTML standard. Yes, you read that correctly. The HTML standard, available at https://html.spec.whatwg.org, encompasses more than just the "HTML language" (tags, attributes) and a slew of objects, methods, and browser-specific DOM extensions. That's "HTML in broad strokes." Additionally, certain parts have supplementary specifications given at https://spec.whatwg.org.
