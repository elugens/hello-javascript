      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: 'Browsers also support properties like window.innerWidth/innerHeight. They look like what we want, but they are not. If a scrollbar exists and takes up some space, clientWidth/clientHeight delivers the width/height without it (subtracts it). In other words, they return the width and height of the visible portion of the page that is accessible for content. The window.innerWidth/innerHeight properties include the scrollbar in their computation. Most of the time, we require the available window width. We should utilize documentElement.clientHeight/clientWidth to draw or place things within the scrollbar (if any).',

      acceptedAnswer: {
        '@type': 'Answer',
        text: "Theoretically, because the root document element document.documentElement and it encloses all of the information, we could measure the total size of the document as document.documentElement.scrollWidth/scrollHeight. However, these attributes do not operate as intended on that element throughout the entire page. If there is no scroll in Chrome/Safari/Opera, documentElement.scrollHeight may be smaller than documentElement.clientHeight! Isn't it strange? To acquire the complete document height with confidence, we should take the greatest of these properties.",

Most browsers support scrollLeft/scrollTop, except older WebKit-based browsers like Safari (bug 5991), where we need to use document.body instead of document.documentElement. Fortunately, we don't have to remember these quirks because the scroll gets provided in the read-only special properties window.pageXOffset/pageYOffset.",

        text: 'To scroll the page with JavaScript, the DOM must be fully constructed. For example, attempting to scroll the page with a script in the &#8249;head&#8250; fails because the DOM is not fully built. It is common to place these scripts at the bottom of the document or in a deferred script. The defer property instructs the browser not to wait for the script to complete. Instead, the browser continues processing the HTML and building the DOM. The script loads "in the background" and starts when the DOM fully builds.',

We implement this for the page by using document.documentElement.scrollTop/scrollLeft (except in Safari, where we should use document.body.scrollTop/Left instead).
