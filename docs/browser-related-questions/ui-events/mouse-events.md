### What is the event order of a mouse left-click in the browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The event order for a mouse left-click in the browser is: 'mousedown', 'mouseup', and then 'click'. If the click was on a link or button, it would then trigger the 'submit' or 'navigate' event. The left button is considered the primary button that returns the event.button equaling zero.

### What differentiates window and document relative mouse positions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Window-relative mouse positions (pageX/Y) are from the top left corner of the whole document and do not change when the page begins to scroll, while document-relative positions (clientX/Y) are from the viewport (visible area of the document).
    </div>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> In summary, document-relative coordinates pageX/Y are numbered from the document's left top corner and do not change when the page begins to scroll. ClientX/Y, on the other hand, are counted from the upper left-hand corner of the current window and do not move or shift when the user navigates the website.

### A double mouse click has the unintended consequence of selecting that text. Is there a method to disable this particular behavior?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>

    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

### Can you block text or image copying in a browser document?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, you can block text or image copying by calling 'event.preventDefault()' in the JavaScript 'copy' event handler attached to the document.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Alternative Response:</strong> Yes, if we want to disable selection to protect our page content from copy-paste by the user, we can use oncopy event and set it to false. This approach doesnâ€™t restrict the user from accessing the page's HTML source, but it does make it more difficult.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<div oncopy="alert('Copying forbidden!'); return false">
  Dear user, The copying is forbidden for you. If you know JS or HTML, then you
  can extract everything from the page source.
</div>
```

### What does 'event bubbling' mean in the context of mouse events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>

### How does 'event.stopPropagation()' affect mouse events?

<details>

### Can you explain the 'pointerlockchange' event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `pointerlockchange` event in JavaScript is fired when the pointer is locked/unlocked. This typically happens when the `requestPointerLock` method is called or when the user exits pointer lock.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('pointerlockchange', function() {
  if (document.pointerLockElement) {
    console.log('The pointer is locked');
  } else {
    console.log('The pointer is not locked');
  }
});

// To request pointer lock
document.body.requestPointerLock();
```

In this code, the `pointerlockchange` event handler checks if `document.pointerLockElement` is set, which would indicate that the pointer is locked. If not, it's unlocked.

### What does 'buttons' property represent in a mouse event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The buttons property in a mouse event represents the state of the buttons pressed on the mouse when the event was fired. Each button corresponds to a unique binary value.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('mousedown', function(e) {
  if (e.buttons == 1) {
      console.log('Left button is pressed');
  } else if (e.buttons == 2) {
      console.log('Right button is pressed');
  } else if (e.buttons == 4) {
      console.log('Middle button is pressed');
  }
});
```

In this example, when a `mousedown` event is fired, the event handler checks the `buttons` property to see which mouse button was pressed. It logs a message depending on whether the left, right, or middle button was pressed.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What does 'detail' property represent in a 'mousedown' or 'mouseup' event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In a `mousedown` or `mouseup` event, the `detail` property represents the number of times the mouse button has been pressed and released on an element without the mouse pointer having moved.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('mousedown', function(e) {
  console.log(`The mouse button was pressed ${e.detail} time(s)`);
});

document.addEventListener('mouseup', function(e) {
  console.log(`The mouse button was released ${e.detail} time(s)`);
});
```

In this example, when a `mousedown` or `mouseup` event is fired, the event handler checks the `detail` property and logs a message indicating how many times the mouse button has been pressed and released.

  </div>
  </div>

### What is the 'auxclick' event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `auxclick` event is a mouse event in JavaScript that gets fired when a non-primary mouse button (usually the middle button) is clicked on an element.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('auxclick', function(e) {
  if (e.button === 1) {
    console.log('Middle button was clicked.');
  }
});
```

In this example, when an `auxclick` event is fired, the event handler checks if the middle mouse button was clicked and logs a message if it was. Please note that not all mice have a middle button.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What is the 'pointerId' property in a mouse event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> In pointer events (not specifically mouse events), `pointerId` is a unique identifier for a particular pointer (like a mouse, pen, or touch contact) involved in the event.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('pointerdown', function(e) {
  console.log(`The pointer id is ${e.pointerId}`);
});
```

In this example, when a `pointerdown` event is fired, the event handler logs the unique identifier of the pointer that triggered the event. This could be useful for distinguishing between different pointers in a multi-touch scenario, for example.

  </div>

### How can you detect the direction of the mouse wheel scroll?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `wheel` event's `deltaY` property can be used to detect the mouse wheel scroll direction in JavaScript. Positive `deltaY` indicates scrolling down, and negative means scrolling up.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
document.addEventListener('wheel', function(e) {
  if (e.deltaY < 0) {
    console.log('Scrolled up');
  } else {
    console.log('Scrolled down');
  }
});
```

In this example, when a `wheel` event is fired, the event handler checks the `deltaY` property to determine the scroll direction. It logs a message depending on whether the user scrolled up or down.
