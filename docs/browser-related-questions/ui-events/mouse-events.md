### Can you prevent copying of text or images in a HTML document?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, if we want to disable selection to protect our page content from copy-paste by the user, then we can use oncopy event and set it too false. This donâ€™t restrict the use from accessing the HTML source of the page, but it does make it more difficult.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<div oncopy="alert('Copying forbidden!'); return false">
  Dear user, The copying is forbidden for you. If you know JS or HTML, then you
  can get everything from the page source though.

```
