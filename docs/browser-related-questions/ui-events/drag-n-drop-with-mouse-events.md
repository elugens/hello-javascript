### When a drag occurs, which event fires when the mouse moves over an element?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'dragover' event fires when a draggable element or selection is being dragged over a potential drop target.
    </div>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The 'dragover' event is triggered as the mouse moves over an element when a drag occurs. The operation during an event is frequently the same as the dragenter event. The dragenter event occurs when a draggable element enters a drop target. A dragleave event occurs when the valid drop target is left. Dragstart gets dispatched whenever a user begins to drag an element.

### How do you make content inside the browser draggable?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> HTML5 includes a drag-and-drop feature. To make content inside the browser draggable, you can set the "draggable" attribute of the element to "true" using JavaScript or HTML.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">HTML Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Draggable Element</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button draggable="true">Draggable Button</button>
    <button>Normal Button</button>
  </body>
</html>

```

### What occurs when a drag action on an element begins?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When a drag action on an element begins, the "dragstart" event is triggered, allowing you to specify the data to be transferred and set up any necessary visual feedback or customization for the drag operation.
  </div>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> There are three factors to remember when a drag event begins: <em>the main points.</em><br/><br/>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Drag Data:</strong> The data type gets sent while dragging occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag Feedback:</strong> This image shows alongside the mouse pointer during a drag action.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag Effect:</strong> This describes the drag that occurs on an element. There are three categories, which are listed below.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong> The data dragged gets copied from its current position to the drop destination if this effect is enabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Move:</strong> This effect indicates that the dragged data is relocating from its original location to the drop destination.</li>
  <li><strong>Link:</strong> This effect suggests that a link or relationship between the source and drop sites gets established.</li>
  </ul>
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

When a drag action begins on an element, the 'dragstart' event is fired. This event triggers a callback function that you can define to perform specific actions. Here's a basic example of how you can bind a 'dragstart' event to an element:

```javascript
var element = document.getElementById('draggableElement');

element.addEventListener('dragstart', function(event) {
    event.dataTransfer.setData('text', event.target.id);
    console.log('Drag action started.');
});
```

In this example, an element with the id 'draggableElement' is selected. Then, an event listener is added for the 'dragstart' event. When a user starts dragging this element, the callback function sets the data type and value of the dragged data (in this case, the id of the dragged element) and logs a message to the console.

### Can you list a few JavaScript drag-and-drop events associated with a callback method?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> JavaScript drag-and-drop events associated with a callback method include dragstart, dragenter, dragover, drop, and dragend.
  </div>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Seven possible drag and drop events can be programmatically associated with a callback method. They include drag, dragstart, dragenter, dragover, dragleave, drop, and dragend.<br/><br/>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>drag:</strong> The drag event triggers every hundred milliseconds as a user drags an object or text selection.</li>
  <li><strong>dragstart:</strong> When a drag starts, it fires on an element.</li>
  <li><strong>dragenter:</strong> this event is triggered when the mouse enters an element while dragging.</li>
  <li><strong>dragover:</strong> When a drag occurs, this event is triggered when the mouse moves over an element.</li>
  <li><strong>dragleave:</strong> This event is triggered when the mouse departs an element while it gets dragged.</li>
  <li><strong>drop:</strong> After the drag operation, the drop event fires on the element where the drop occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>dragend:</strong> When the drag operation finishes, whether it was successful, the drag source receives the dragend event.</li>
  </ul>
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
var draggableElement = document.getElementById('draggableElement');
var droppableElement = document.getElementById('droppableElement');

draggableElement.addEventListener('dragstart', function(event) {
    event.dataTransfer.setData('text', event.target.id);
});

droppableElement.addEventListener('dragover', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Necessary to allow drop.
});

droppableElement.addEventListener('drop', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var data = event.dataTransfer.getData('text');
    event.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
});
```

### What exactly is the dataTransfer property?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The dataTransfer property is a property of the drag and drop events in JavaScript that allows you to access and manipulate the data being transferred during a drag and drop operation. The dataTransfer property holds data about the user interaction, like the type and value of data being dragged during a drag and drop operation. The dragstart event sets dataTransfer, which is read/handled in the drop event.
