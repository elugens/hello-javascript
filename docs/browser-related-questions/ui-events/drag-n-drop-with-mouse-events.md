### When a drag occurs, which event fires when the mouse moves over an element?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The dragover event is triggered as the mouse moves over an element when a drag occurs. The operation during an event is frequently the same as the dragenter event. The dragenter event occurs when a draggable element enters a drop target. A dragleave event occurs when the valid drop target is left. Dragstart gets dispatched whenever a user begins to drag an element.

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Drag Data:</strong> The data type gets sent while dragging occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag Feedback:</strong> This image shows alongside the mouse pointer during a drag action.</li>
  <li><strong>Drag Effect:</strong> This describes the drag that occurs on an element. There are three categories, which are listed below.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong> The data dragged gets copied from its current position to the drop destination if this effect is enabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Move:</strong> This effect indicates that the dragged data is relocating from its original location to the drop destination.</li>
  <li><strong>Link:</strong> This effect suggests that a link or relationship between the source and drop sites gets established.</li>
  </ul>
