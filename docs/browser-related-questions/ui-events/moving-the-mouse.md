### How does the 'mouseout' event differ from 'mouseover'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `mouseout` event in JavaScript triggers when the mouse pointer leaves the area of an element, opposite to `mouseover` which triggers when the mouse enters.

  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is the 'mouseenter' event in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `mouseenter` fires when the pointer moves into the target element, not including its children.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How does 'mouseleave' differ from 'mouseenter'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `mouseenter` triggers when the mouse enters an element, `mouseleave` when it leaves. Unlike `mouseover` and `mouseout`, these events do not bubble and ignore child elements.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### When would you use 'mouseover' over 'mouseenter'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> We use mouseover when you want the event to bubble up the DOM and also trigger for child elements. Use mouseenter when only interested in the event for the target element.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Why might you use 'mouseleave' instead of 'mouseout'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You should use `mouseleave` instead of `mouseout` to avoid event triggering when the mouse moves over child elements. `mouseleave` only triggers when exiting the target element's area.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you explain the read-only property 'relatedTarget' in a mouseover and 'mouseout' event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `relatedTarget` property in mouseover and mouseout events specifies the secondary target involved in the event - the element the mouse just left or entered, respectively.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('myElement');

element.addEventListener('mouseover', function(event) {
    let related = event.relatedTarget;
    console.log('Mouse entered from:', related.id);
});

element.addEventListener('mouseout', function(event) {
    let related = event.relatedTarget;
    console.log('Mouse left to:', related.id);
});
```

In this example, when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the area of the `myElement` element, it logs where the mouse came from or where it's going to next.

  </div>
  </div>

### Can the 'relatedTarget' be null during a mouseover/mouseout event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, `relatedTarget` can be null in a `mouseover` event when the mouse enters from outside the window, or in a `mouseout` event when the mouse leaves the window.
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Yes, the relatedTarget property is nullable. That is normal because it implies that the mouse originated from outside the window rather than another element. Or that it walked out the window. When utilizing event.relatedTarget in our code, we should keep that option in mind. There are issues if we try to access event.relatedTarget.tagName.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('myElement');

element.addEventListener('mouseover', function(event) {
    if(event.relatedTarget === null) {
        console.log('Mouse came from outside the window.');
    }
});

element.addEventListener('mouseout', function(event) {
    if(event.relatedTarget === null) {
        console.log('Mouse is going outside the window.');
    }
});
```

In this example, when the mouse comes from outside the window or goes outside the window, it logs a message to the console.

### Does the mouse trigger an event for every element it crosses?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, the mouse triggers `mouseover` and `mouseout` events for every element it crosses. However, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events only trigger for the targeted element.
    </div>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> No, the mousemove event triggers when the mouse moves. But that does not guarantee that every pixel leads to an event. The browser checks the mouse position from time to time. And if it notices changes then it triggers the events. Some DOM elements may get skipped if the visitor is moving the mouse extremely fast. That is good for performance because there may be many intermediate elements. We do not want to process in and out of each one.

### How do mouseenter/mouseleave and mouseover/mouseout differ?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `mouseover`/`mouseout` trigger for an element and its children, while `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` only trigger for the target element, ignoring child elements.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> Events mouseenter/mouseleave are like mouseover/mouseout. They trigger when the mouse pointer enters/leaves the element. But there are two crucial differences. Transitions inside the element, to/from descendants, are not counted. Events mouseenter/mouseleave do not bubble.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<div id="parent" onmouseenter="mouselog(event)" onmouseleave="mouselog(event)">
  <!-- parent -->
  <div id="child">child</div>
</div>
```

  </div>
  </div>

### Can you use these mouse events on touch devices?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> While some touch devices may trigger mouse events, it's inconsistent across devices and browsers. Instead, it's recommended to use touch events like `touchstart`, `touchend`.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the sequence of these mouse events when the mouse pointer enters and leaves an element?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Upon entering an element: `mouseover`, then `mouseenter`. Upon leaving an element: `mouseout`, then `mouseleave`. Note that these events do not fire in the same way for child elements.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is a "dead zone" in the context of mouse events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A "dead zone" in mouse events refers to an area within an element where, despite mouse movement, mouseleave or mouseout events aren't triggered, preventing unintentional event firing.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can mouse movement events be triggered programmatically?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, mouse events can be triggered programmatically using the dispatchEvent method in conjunction with the MouseEvent constructor to create the event.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('myElement');

let mouseEvent = new MouseEvent('mouseover', {
    'view': window,
    'bubbles': true,
    'cancelable': true
});

element.dispatchEvent(mouseEvent);

element.addEventListener('mouseover', function(event) {
    console.log('Mouseover event triggered programmatically');
});
```

In this code, a `mouseover` event is created and then dispatched on the element with id 'myElement'. When this event occurs, a message is logged to the console.

  </div>
  </div>

### What is the effect of event bubbling in the context of mouse events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Event bubbling with mouse events means the event propagates from the innermost element (target) outwards. If a child and parent both have a `mouseover` event, the child's fires first.
  </div><br />
  </div>
