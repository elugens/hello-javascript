### What does the scroll event allow in terms of a page or element?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The scroll event seeks to respond to the scrolling of a page or element. We have a lot of nice things we can do here. For example, based on where the user is in the document, reveal or conceal extra controls or informationâ€”load extra info when the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page (lazy load).

```html
<style>
  #showScroll {
    height: 5000px;
    padding-top: 500px;
  }
</style>
<div id="showScroll" onscroll="scroll();">0</div>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('scroll', function () {
    document.getElementById('showScroll').innerHTML = window.pageYOffset + 'px';

### How can we block scrolling on a web page in the browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> We cannot use event.preventDefault() in the onscroll listener to prevent scrolling because it fires after the scroll has already occurred. We may, however, disable event-based scrolling by using preventDefault() which invokes on a scroll-triggering event, such as the keydown event for pageUp and pageDown. The scroll does not begin if we add an event handler to these events and use event.preventDefault().
