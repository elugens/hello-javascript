### What is a scroll event in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The scroll event in JavaScript is triggered when the user scrolls up or down on a web page or an element. It's often used to implement dynamic loading or reveal animations as a user scrolls.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple example in JavaScript. This code alerts a message when the user scrolls.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
    alert('You just scrolled!');
});
```

Please replace `alert` with a more user-friendly function in a real application, as multiple scrolls could lead to many alert boxes.

### When are scroll events typically used?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Scroll events are used to execute code when the user scrolls a page or element, often for effects like parallax or infinite scrolling.

### What is 'onscroll' in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'onscroll' is a built-in JavaScript event handler that executes a script when a user scrolls up or down on a webpage or an element. It's an alternative way to attach a scroll event.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's an example that shows how to use the 'onscroll' event in JavaScript. This code changes the background color of the body when the user scrolls.

```javascript
window.onscroll = function() {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
};
```

Remember to replace the function with one that suits your application needs. This is just a simple example to demonstrate the concept.

### What is a common problem with scroll events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Scroll events can lead to performance issues if not handled properly, because they can fire many times per second during scrolling, which could overload the browser if the handler function is complex.
  </div><br />
  </div>

### What is debounce in the context of scroll events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Debouncing in the context of scroll events is a technique that limits the rate at which a function fires, reducing the number of times an event handler is executed during repetitive events like scrolling.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple JavaScript debounce function, followed by its usage with a scroll event.

```javascript
// Simple debounce function
function debounce(func, wait) {
    let timeout;
    return function() {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, arguments), wait);
    }
}

// Function to execute on scroll
function handleScroll() {
    console.log('Scrolled!');
}

// Attach event with debounced function
window.addEventListener('scroll', debounce(handleScroll, 200));
```

In this example, `handleScroll` will not be called more than once every 200 milliseconds while scrolling. This helps to prevent performance issues associated with rapid firing of scroll events.

### What is throttle in the context of scroll events?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Throttling in the context of scroll events is a technique that ensures a function only fires at most once every specified interval, regardless of how many times the event occurs.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
// Simple throttle function
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let lastCall;
    return function() {
        const now = Date.now();
        if (!lastCall || (now - lastCall) > limit) {
            lastCall = now;
            return func.apply(this, arguments);
        }
    }
}

// Function to execute on scroll
function handleScroll() {
    console.log('Scrolled!');
}

// Attach event with throttled function
window.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(handleScroll, 200));
```

In this example, `handleScroll` will not be called more than once every 200 milliseconds while scrolling, helping to prevent performance issues associated with frequent firing of scroll events.

### What is scroll chaining?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Scroll chaining is a browser feature where, if a user reaches the edge of a scrollable element, the scroll action continues (or "chains") to the parent element, until it reaches the viewport.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Scroll chaining is a browser default behavior, and it doesn't need explicit JavaScript code to function. Here is a simple HTML example that can exhibit scroll chaining:

```html
<div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; overflow: auto;">
    <div style="width: 500px; height: 500px;">
        Scroll inside this inner div, and when you reach the edge, it will start scrolling in the outer div.
    </div>
</div>
```

When you scroll inside the inner div and reach its boundaries, the scroll action will chain to the outer div, i.e., the parent element.

However, starting from Chrome 63, you can control scroll chaining behavior using CSS's `overscroll-behavior` property.

```css
#element {
    overscroll-behavior: contain; /* prevents scroll chaining */
}
```

The `overscroll-behavior` property can take one of the following values: `auto`, `contain`, and `none`. The `contain` value prevents scroll chaining but keeps the bounce effect on devices that support it.

### What is a passive event listener?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> A passive event listener in JavaScript is an option you can use to improve scroll performance by indicating that an event listener won't call preventDefault(), thus enabling the browser to continue scrolling without waiting.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
// Function to execute on scroll
function handleScroll(event) {
    console.log('Scrolled!');
}

// Attach passive event listener
document.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true });
```

In this example, the `{ passive: true }` option indicates that the `handleScroll` function won't prevent the scroll event's default behavior, so the browser doesn't need to wait before continuing to scroll. This can help improve scroll performance, especially on touch and mobile devices.

### How can we detect the scroll direction?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can detect the scroll direction by comparing the current scroll position with the last known position, updating the last position after the check. If it's greater, it's a down scroll, else it's up.</div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```javascript
let lastScrollTop = 0;

window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
    let currentScrollTop = window.pageYOffset || document.documentElement.scrollTop;

    if (currentScrollTop > lastScrollTop){
        console.log('Scrolled down');
    } else {
        console.log('Scrolled up');
    }

    lastScrollTop = currentScrollTop;
}, false);
```

In this example, we're storing the last known scroll position in `lastScrollTop`. On each scroll event, we compare the current scroll position (`currentScrollTop`) with the last known position to determine the scroll direction. We then update `lastScrollTop` with the current position.

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'window.scrollTo' method in JavaScript is used to scroll to a specific set of coordinates in the document. It accepts two arguments: the X-coordinate (horizontal scroll) and Y-coordinate (vertical scroll).
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is 'requestAnimationFrame' in the context of scrolling?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> 'requestAnimationFrame' in the context of scrolling is often used to optimize scroll events or animations, ensuring they're synced with the browser's refresh rate, reducing jank and improving performance.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How does 'Intersection Observer API' relate to scrolling?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or viewport, which is useful in handling scroll events effectively.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's an example of how you might use the Intersection Observer API to detect when an element becomes visible in the viewport as a result of scrolling:

```javascript
// Function to execute when the observed element intersects with the viewport
function handleIntersect(entries, observer) {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            console.log('Element is in the viewport!');
        }
    });
}

// Create a new Intersection Observer instance
let observer = new IntersectionObserver(handleIntersect);

// Target element to observe
let target = document.querySelector('#targetElement');

// Start observing the target element
observer.observe(target);
```

In this example, we first define a `handleIntersect` function that will be called whenever the observed element intersects with the viewport. Then, we create a new `IntersectionObserver` instance, specifying `handleIntersect` as the callback function. Finally, we start observing a target element by calling `observer.observe(target)`.

  </div>

### What is 'scroll snapping'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Scroll snapping is a web design technique where the scroll position automatically adjusts or "snaps" to a certain point, such as the start of a section, as the user scrolls through a document.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What is the 'scroll-behavior' property in CSS?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The 'scroll-behavior' property in CSS specifies whether the scrolling transition of a container is smooth (animated) or instant. It accepts two values: 'auto' for instant scrolling, and 'smooth' for smooth scrolling.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple example of how to use the 'scroll-behavior' property in CSS:

```css
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

In this example, when links are clicked that point to different sections of the webpage, the browser will smoothly animate scrolling to those sections, rather than instantly jumping to them. It's worth noting that 'scroll-behavior' will only have effect if the element being scrolled to is within the same document.

  </div>
  </div>

### Can you explain 'window.scrollBy'?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> 'window.scrollBy' is a method that scrolls the document by the specified number of pixels. It's relative to the current scroll position.
  </div><br/>

### What does the scroll event allow in terms of a page or element?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The scroll event allows executing JavaScript code when a user scrolls a page or element, enabling dynamic effects like parallax scrolling, lazy-loading, or infinite scrolling.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The scroll event seeks to respond to the scrolling of a page or element. We have a lot of nice things we can do here. For example, based on where the user is in the document, reveal or conceal extra controls or information—load extra info when the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page (lazy load).
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<style>
  #showScroll {
    height: 5000px;
    padding-top: 500px;
  }
</style>
<div id="showScroll" onscroll="scroll();">0</div>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('scroll', function () {
    document.getElementById('showScroll').innerHTML = window.pageYOffset + 'px';
  });
</script>
```

  </div>

### How can we block scrolling on a web page in the browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> To block scrolling, you can set 'overflow' to 'hidden' on the body element in CSS, preventing the user from scrolling on the webpage.
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> We cannot use event.preventDefault() in the onscroll listener to prevent scrolling because it fires after the scroll has already occurred. We may, however, disable event-based scrolling by using preventDefault() which invokes on a scroll-triggering event, such as the keydown event for pageUp and pageDown. The scroll does not begin if we add an event handler to these events and use event.preventDefault().
