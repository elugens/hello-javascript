### What are form submission events in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Form submission events in JavaScript are triggered actions that occur when a form is submitted. They allow manipulation and validation of form data before it's sent to a server.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### What's the purpose of the 'submit' event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The `submit` event in JavaScript is triggered when a form is submitted. It allows developers to handle, validate, or modify form data before it's sent to the server.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### How can you validate form data before submission?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can validate form data before submission by attaching a `submit` event handler to the form and inspecting the input values for compliance with desired rules.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simple one showing form validation in JavaScript:

```javascript
document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    var input = this.querySelector("input[type=text]");
    if (!input.value || input.value.length < 5) {
        console.log("Please provide at least 5 characters.");
        event.preventDefault();
    }
});
```

This code attaches a submit event listener to a form, and then checks to see if a text input's value is not empty and has at least 5 characters. If these conditions are not met, it runs a console.log and cancels the form submission.

  </div>
  </div>

### What is FormData in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> `FormData` in JavaScript is an API providing a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can be sent using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's an example of using `FormData` in JavaScript:

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('form');
var formData = new FormData(form);

formData.append('customKey', 'customValue'); // appending additional data

fetch('/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});
```

This code grabs a form from the page, creates a `FormData` object from it, appends a custom key/value pair, and then sends it to a server via a POST request using the `fetch` API.

  </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Can you attach multiple handlers to the same form submission event?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, multiple event handlers can be attached to the same form submission event in JavaScript. They will be invoked in the order they were added.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's an example showing how to attach multiple handlers to the same form submission event:

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('form');

form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    console.log('Handler 1');
    event.preventDefault();
});

form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    console.log('Handler 2');
    event.preventDefault();
});
```

In this code, two handlers are attached to the form's `submit` event. When the form is submitted, 'Handler 1' and 'Handler 2' will be logged to the console in that order. The `event.preventDefault()` prevents the form from being submitted.

  </div>
  </div>

### How can you simulate a form submission event in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Yes, multiple event handlers can be attached to the same form submission event in JavaScript. They will be invoked in the order they were added.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here is an example of how to simulate a form submission event in JavaScript:

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('form');

// Using the form's submit method
form.submit();

// Or by creating a new event and dispatching it
var event = new Event('submit');
form.dispatchEvent(event);
```

The first method directly submits the form. The second method creates a new `submit` event and dispatches it, triggering any attached `submit` event handlers.

### What is event bubbling in the context of form submission?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Event bubbling in form submission context refers to an event propagating up the DOM tree, allowing parent elements to respond to a submission event triggered on a child form element.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### How can you stop event propagation in form submissions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can stop event propagation in form submissions by calling `event.stopPropagation()` or `event.preventDefault()` within the event handler in JavaScript.</div>
  </div>
</details>

### How do you capture form data without submitting the form?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> You can use FormData object or access form elements directly to get their values.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> When working with form elements, there are two main ways to retrieve the values submitted by the user. The first method is to access the form elements directly, which involves referencing the specific input, select, or textarea element and retrieving its value property. Alternatively, you can make use of the FormData object, which provides a more efficient and streamlined way of accessing form data. With the FormData object, you can easily retrieve all the form data at once and send it to the server for further processing.

### What happens when we submit a form in the browser?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When a form is submitted, the submit event is triggered. It often gets used to verify the form (form validation) before sending it to the server or cancel the submission and process it in JavaScript. The function form.submit() enables us to transmit forms from JavaScript, and we may use it to construct and send forms to the server dynamically.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

### What are the two ways to allow a user to submit a form?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> There are two primary methods for submitting a form. The first step is to select either &#8249;input type="submit"&#8250; or &#8249;input type="image"&#8250;. The second method is to enter data into an input field by pressing Enter. Both activities result in the form's submit-event. The handler can inspect the data, display them, and call events if any issues appear. If you use `preventDefault()`, the form does not transmit to the server.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<form onsubmit="console.log('submit!');return false">
  First: Enter in the input field <input type="text" value="text" /><br />
  Second: Click "submit": <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

  </div>
  </div>

### What is the relation between submit and click?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> When a form gets sent using Enter on an input field, a click event triggers on the &#8249;input type="submit"&#8250;. That is rather funny because there was no click at all.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<form onsubmit="return false">
  <input type="text" size="30" value="Focus here and press enter" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="console.log('click')" />
</form>
```

  </div>

### What happens if a form submit event listener returns false?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Returning false from a submit event listener is similar to calling event.preventDefault(). It stops the form submission.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### Why might you use the FormData object in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest or fetch.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

### Can you explain synchronous versus asynchronous form submission?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Synchronous submission refreshes the page. Asynchronous, using AJAX or Fetch API, submits data without refreshing.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What's the difference between event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault() in form submission context?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> event.stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, event.preventDefault() prevents the default form submission.
  </div><br />
  </div>
</details>

---

### What is the purpose of the action attribute in a form?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The action attribute defines the URL where the form data is sent on submission.
  </div><br />

### How can you handle file uploads in JavaScript form submissions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Handling file uploads in form submissions typically involves using the FormData object and the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API to send the form data to the server.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to handle file uploads in JavaScript form submissions:

1. Create an HTML form with an input field of type "file" to allow users to select the file(s) they want to upload. For example:

```html
<form id="myForm">
  <input type="file" name="myFile" id="fileInput">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

2. Add an event listener to the form's submit event so that when the form is submitted, the file(s) are uploaded. For example, using JavaScript:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from submitting normally

  var fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput");
  var files = fileInput.files; // Get the selected files

  if (files.length > 0) {
    var formData = new FormData(); // Create a new FormData object

    for (var i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
      var file = files[i];
      formData.append("files[]", file, file.name); // Append each file to the FormData object
    }

    // Send the form data using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API
    // You can choose one of the following approaches
  }
});
```

3. Use XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API to send the form data to the server. Here are examples of both approaches:

Using XMLHttpRequest:

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", "/upload", true); // Specify the URL where you want to send the data

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
      // File(s) uploaded successfully
      console.log(xhr.responseText);
    } else {
      // An error occurred
      console.log("Error:", xhr.status);
    }
  }
};

xhr.send(formData); // Send the FormData object
```

Using Fetch API:

```javascript
fetch("/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData // Pass the FormData object as the body of the request
})
.then(function(response) {
  if (response.ok) {
    // File(s) uploaded successfully
    return response.text();
  } else {
    // An error occurred
    throw new Error("Error: " + response.status);
  }
})
.then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
})
.catch(function(error) {
  console.log(error);
});
```

4. On the server-side, you need to handle the file upload request and process the uploaded file(s) according to your server-side technology of choice (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.).

Remember to update the URL ("/upload" in the examples) in the JavaScript code to match the endpoint on your server where you handle the file upload.

That's it! This is a basic approach to handle file uploads in JavaScript form submissions. Keep in mind that there are additional considerations like file size limits, file type validation, and security measures that you might want to implement based on your specific requirements.

### Why might you use AJAX in form submissions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> AJAX allows asynchronous form submissions, providing a smoother user experience by not requiring a page reload.

### What is CSRF and how does it relate to form submissions?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> CSRF is a type of attack where unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user, this can be mitigated by using CSRF tokens in forms.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that tricks users into unknowingly submitting malicious requests. It can be relevant to form submissions as it can enable an attacker to submit unwanted form data on behalf of the victim user without their consent. This can be mitigated by using CSRF tokens in forms.
  </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

  <div></div>

Here's a simplified code example illustrating a CSRF vulnerability and how it can be exploited:

```html
<!-- Vulnerable Website: transfer_funds.html -->
<html>
<head>
  <title>Transfer Funds</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Transfer Funds</h1>
  <form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
    <input type="hidden" name="destination" value="attacker_account">
    <input type="submit" value="Transfer">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the vulnerable website "transfer_funds.html" contains a form that initiates a transfer of funds. The form sends a POST request to the "<https://bank.com/transfer>" endpoint with hidden input fields for the amount and destination account.

An attacker can create a malicious website:

```html
<!-- Malicious Website: csrf_attack.html -->
<html>
<head>
  <title>CSRF Attack</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Click the Button!</h1>
  <img src="https://bank.com/transfer_funds.html" style="display: none" onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
</body>
</html>
```

The attacker includes an invisible image element that references the vulnerable website "transfer_funds.html" as the image source. When a user visits the attacker's website, the hidden image loads the vulnerable website, triggering the form submission automatically.

Since the user is already authenticated on the bank's website, the form submission is treated as a legitimate action, transferring funds from their account to the attacker's account.

This example demonstrates how CSRF can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions using a victim user's authenticated session by tricking them into submitting a form without their knowledge or consent. This can be mitigated by using CSRF tokens in forms.
