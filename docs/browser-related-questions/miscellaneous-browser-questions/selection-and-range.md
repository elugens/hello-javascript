### Can you describe the fundamentals of selection in JavaScript?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Selection is an interface that represents user-selected text or the current input cursor position. It's obtained using Window.getSelection() and manipulated using methods like addRange() or removeAllRanges().
    </div><br/>
  <div><strong>Technical Details:</strong> JavaScript may access a current selection, select and deselect DOM nodes whole or partially, delete the selected content from the document, and encapsulate it in a tag. Range is the primary selection idea, and it is just a pair of "border points": range start and range end.

### Can you please explain the function of the Range Object/interface?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> The Range interface represents a document fragment that can contain nodes and parts of text nodes. It enables manipulation of document content, supporting complex content operations.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The Range interface represents a document fragment that can contain nodes and parts of text nodes. The `Range()` constructor returns a newly created Range object whose start and the end are the global Document object. A Range object gets created without parameters in its initial state. Then we can set the selection boundaries using `range.setStart(node, offset)` and `range.setEnd(node, offset)`. Surprisingly, the first parameter node in both systems can be either a text node or an element node, and the meaning of the second argument is dependent on this.

<strong>Syntax: </strong> let range = new Range();<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<p id="p">Hello</p>
<script>
  let range = new Range();
  range.setStart(p.firstChild, 2);
  range.setEnd(p.firstChild, 4);

  // toString of a range returns its content as text
  console.log(range); // ll

### Can you explain the function of the Window.getSelection() method?

<details>
  <summary><strong>View Answer:</strong></summary>
  <div>
  <div><strong>Interview Response:</strong> Window.getSelection() returns a Selection object representing the text currently selected or the caret's position in the document. It's useful for text manipulation tasks.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong>Technical Response:</strong> The `window.getSelection()` method returns a Selection object representing the range of text selected by the user or the caret's current position. The document selection is represented as a Selection object, which may be accessed by `window.getSelection()` or `document.getSelection()`. A selection may contain 0 or more ranges.
    </div><br />
  <div><strong className="codeExample">Code Example:</strong><br /><br />

<strong>Syntax: </strong> let range = new Range()let selection = window.getSelection();<br /><br />

  <div></div>

```html
<p id="p">Select me: <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b></p>

From <input id="from" disabled /> â€“ To <input id="to" disabled />
<script>
  document.onselectionchange = function () {
    let selection = document.getSelection();

    let { anchorNode, anchorOffset, focusNode, focusOffset } = selection;

    // anchorNode and focusNode are text nodes usually
    from.value = `${anchorNode?.data}, offset ${anchorOffset}`;
    to.value = `${focusNode?.data}, offset ${focusOffset}`;
  };
</script>
```
