**Adding questions about FormData soon...**

<!-- Questions -->
Can you explain how we use the Formdata object to send data to a server?

The FormData interface lets us easily build a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which we send using the fetch() or XMLHttpRequest.send() method. It uses the same format a form would use if the encoding type gets set to "multipart/form-data".
